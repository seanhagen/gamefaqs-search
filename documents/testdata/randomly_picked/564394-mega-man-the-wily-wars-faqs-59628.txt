-----------------------------------About Me-----------------------------------
==============================================================================

I have played Mega Man since literally the day I can remember. The first Mega
Man game I can remember playing is Mega Man 2 on the NES. The first Robot
Master I can remember fighting is Wood Man, which makes him one of my favorite
Robot Masters. Mega Man has always been my favorite video game icon since I
was a kid. I own every American released Classic Mega Man and Mega Man X game.
I don't really play the other series' though.

==============================================================================
--------------------------------About This FAQ--------------------------------
==============================================================================

I decided to write this FAQ for anyone who hasn't been into Mega Man for very
long and wants to better themselfs at fighting the Robot Masters with only the
Mega Buster. I decided to include some videos of me fighting the Robot Masters
just incase you can't understand what I am saying in this FAQ, you will have a
visual example to go off of. I hope this guide helps you!

I have covered all the Robot Master Battles from Mega Man's 1 - 10, Mega Man &
Bass. The Stardroids from Mega Man V, the Mega Man Killers, the Doc Robots
from Mega Man 3, and Bonus Battles against Mega Man Himself, Dark Man, and
Fake Man I hope this guide helps you out! If you don't understand what I am
saying in this FAQ, then follow the links after each Robot Master description
to see a video of me personally taking out the Robot Masters, hopefully a
visual example will help! If you like what you see then Subscribe to me on
youtube, my username on there is Redmage1987. If you need help on any of the
other Robot Masters, check out my guides for them on their FAQ Page.

----------------------------------MEGA MAN 3----------------------------------
==============================================================================

In Mega Man 3, we have the new ability to slide. It's also the first game in
the series to star Rush the dog as well, very good classic in my opinion, but
here we go. If you would like stragety's on how to Buster only battle the Doc
Robots then look near the end of this guide.

------Spark Man------

Difficulty: 7/10

Small Spark-- 2
Large Spark-- 4
Collision---- 4

Spark Man can be kind of tough. He will jump around the room, stopping only to
release a whole bunch of sparks right before charging up one big spark. Do your
best to jump between whatever small ones you can, and try to trick Spark Man
into shooting the big Spark in the wrong direction, if you are below Spark Man
try and jump to make him throw it above you and slide under it, or if you are
above him jump down and the back up to go over it, or wait a sec then jump to
make him throw it too high. Run or Slide under him when you get the chance.

Spark Man's Fight is from 0:01 - 0:33


------Snake Man------

Difficulty: 3/10

Search Snake-- 4
Collision----- 6

Snake Man is one of the least threatening Robot Master's in the classic 
series. All you really need to do is chase him and jump over him. When the
fight starts shoot at him from across the room, he will start running to your
side of the room, either jump over him and land on the post in the middle of
the room or slide under him and then jump onto the post in the middle of the
room. Now, stand on the post and shoot at him to the left, once he starts
running back to the right, jump over him (and any Search Snake's he may have
fired) and get back onto the post and fire at him to the right, once he starts
running left, jump over him and then get back on, repeate and he should be
dead before you know it. Also, as a side note, you can kill the Search Snakes
he fires at you as well.

------Needle Man------

Difficulty: 6/10

Needle Cannon-- 3
Needle Crown--- 6
Collision------ 4

Needle Man has 2 main attacks, his Needle Cannon and the Crown of Needle's on
his head. He tends to use the Needle Cannon more often when you are far away
and the Needle Crown more often when you are closer to him. You will want to
try and make him do his Needle Crown more often than the Needle Cannon,
because sometimes the Needle Cannon can be kind of tough to dodge, basically
if he uses Needle Cannon just jump over them and slide under any others that
come your way, try and close in on him and stay near him to try and make him
use the Needle Crown, to dodge this all you need to do is jump, simple. Follow
this and he shouldn't pose too much of a problem.

Needle Man's Fight is from 1:09 - 1:54


------Top Man------

Difficulty: 2/10

Tops--------- 4
Spin Attack-- 6
Collision---- 6

Top Man is by far the easiest one in Mega Man 3 and is also one of the easiest
ones to fight in the classic series. He takes 2 damage per shot. At the start
of the fight he will throw 3 tops into the air which will stay airborne for
about 1.5 seconds before homing in on you, so wait a second and then slide
towards Top Man to dodge them, after that Top Man will Spin and move across
the room, you cannot hurt him while he is spinning, so try and get hits in on
him while he is throwing the tops into the air, just jump over him to avoid
his Spin Attack. Like I said, he is very easy.

Top Man's Fight is from 1:55 - 2:21


------Shadow Man------

Difficulty: 9/10

Shadow Blade-- 4
Slide--------- 6
Collision----- 4

Shadow Man is one of the hardest to fight in the entire classic series. He is
somewhat unpredictable and he is very fast as well. Shadow Man will always
jump 2 - 3 times and then he will either throw Shadow Blades or Slide at you.
Try to keep as much distance as possible between you and him at all times to
give you as much time to react as possible. If he slides jump over him and if
he throws Shadow Blades Jump over the lower one. He can be tricky because you
don't know which one he is going to do, and if he slides you must jump quick
and if he throws Shadow Blades you must wait a sec before jumping, this is why
you must keep distance between the two of you.

Shadow Man's Fight is from 2:22 - 2:49


------Magnet Man------

Difficulty: 4/10

Magnet Missile-- 3
Collision------- 6

Magnet Man is pretty simple and he takes 2 damage per shot. He will always do
a short hop and then a big hop to get across the room. Slide Under him when he
does the big hop to get around him. Once he is on either side of the room he
will do one of two attacks. He will either go to the ceiling and fire 3 Magnet
Missile down at you, which to dodge these simply move forward a little bit and
try to get behind him AFTER the third one, if you get behind him too quick he
will turn around and get you. The other attack is to try and pull you towards
him, simply run the other way, you can't hurt him while he is doing this
either.

Magnet Man's Fight is from 2:50 - 3:23


------Gemini Man------

Difficulty: 7/10

Gemini Twin Shot--- 3
Gemini Laser------- 6
Collision---------- 6

Gemini Man is one of the funner battles but can also be kind of hard unless
you know what to do. At the beginning of the fight he will split into 2 Gemini
"Men" and start running around the room. What you will want to do is go to the
middle of the room and shoot at the one to your left. DO NOT RAPID FIRE!
Everytime you shoot, the one on the ground shoots too, so only shoot 1 shot at
a time, shoot and then jump up and towards him to avoid his shot and him as he
runs toward you. When Gemini Man reach's half health, the clone will die off
and it will be 1 on 1. Now everytime you shoot him, he will jump. So just
shoot him like mad otherwise he will get off his Gemini Laser which will bounce
around and make another obstacle for you to put up with. Shoot him to make him
jump and slide under him when you need to get around him.

Gemini Man's Fight is from 3:24 - 3:54


------Hard Man------

Difficulty: 5/10

Hard Knuckle-- 3
Head Dive----- 12
Collision----- 6

To be honest, so long as you don't take any collission damage from Hard Man,
Mega Man can tank the hits from his Hard Knuckles and unload on him and still
win, but assuming you want to use a little bit more than that I will describe
how to actually dodge his attacks. When the fight starts he will shoot 2 Hard
Knuckles at you, now normally they would turn around and retarget once they go
past you, but if you stay against the either wall and jump over them this will
make them go off screen then they won't come back. If they do come back though
just jump over them or slide under them to avoid them. After Hard Man fires
off his Hard Knuckles he will jump in the air and come back down head first
with enough impact to stun Mega Man even in mid air, but it won't matter
because he won't be able to do anything while he is eating dirt. So basically
try to lead his Hard Knuckles off the side of the screen and unload on him.

-----------------------------MEGA MAN 3 Doc Robots----------------------------
==============================================================================

Here we will cover how to fight all the Doc Robots in Mega Man 3 with just the
Mega Buster, for the most part some of the Doc Robot's fight the same way as
their Mega Man 2 counterpart, but for some of them you need all new strategys
to fight. Here we will cover what to do.

------Doc Metal Man------

Difficulty: 4/10

Metal Blade-- 3
Collision---- 6

Doc Metal Man's main difference from the battle against Metal Man in Mega Man
2 is that there is no Conveyor and he is a bigger target. He still isn't that
hard if you keep your distance from him. At the beginning of the battle just
jump and shoot and shoot 1 more shot as you come down, to try and score 2 hits
If Doc Metal Man throws 1 or 2 Metal Blades, jump over them, if he throws 3,
jump over the first 2 and slide under the 3rd one. If you get too close to him
he will jump to the other side of the room, so try and stay on the left side.

------Doc Quick Man------

Difficulty: 7/10

Quick Boomerang-- 2
Collision-------- 8

Doc Quick Man is easily in the Top 5 most difficult battles to do with the
Mega Buster. Doc Quick Man is the Fastest of all the Doc Robot's Obviously.
He only takes 1 damage per shot, and hitting him is often annoying. When the
fight starts he will either jump to where you're standing or jump somewhere
around the middle of the room, basically you will want to try and get him in a
position to where you can make him jump so you can slide under him and avoid
his boomerangs or in a position to where you can jump over him and his
boomerangs. No matter what, almost this entire fight you will be focusing on
finding a way to avoid him and his boomerangs in one go, which is often hard
to do since this battle is so fast paced. Do your best to hit Doc Quick Man
and avoid his boomerangs in one go. If you are forced to take damage, try to
let the boomerangs hit you and not Doc Quick Man, you will take much less
damage that way.

------Doc Air Man------

Difficulty: 7/10

Air Shooter-- 4
Collision---- 8

Doc Air Man isn't that bad, it's all a matter of what pattern of Tornados he
throws at you. He also goes down quick because he takes 2 damage per shot.
Basically he will shoot 2 to 3 rounds of tornado's at you, all of which will
blow you away from him. At the beginning of the fight, just stay against the
wall and do you best to jump over the tornado's safely, this time around
though, you have the slide to help with dodging some of the pattens. Try to
shoot between the tornados to hit him in the mean time. He will jump over to
your side, just stay against the wall and jump as he is landing near you to
avoid collision damage, then let loose on him while he prepares another set
of tornados and use the boost from the wind to jump over him and stay against
the right wall and repeate When he jumps over to your side again.

------Doc Crash Man------

Difficulty: 5/10

Crash Bomb------------ 4
Crash Bomb Explosion-- 4
Collision------------- 4

Doc Crash Man is the easiest Doc Robot to buster only kill. That is, of
course, if you take your time with him. Everytime you shoot, he will jump and
shoot a Crash Bomb at where you are standing, so what you will want to do is
jump and shoot so he intercepts the bullet as he jumps and keep moving to the
right, once you reach the right wall or once the Crash Bomb he fired is
done exploding turn around, then Jump and Shoot again and keep moving left
until you get to the left wall or once the 2nd Crash Bomb he fired is done
exploding and just repeate, sometimes he will jump and shoot a Crash Bomb on
his own, just slide to dodge the Crash Bomb and continue.

------Doc Wood Man------

Difficulty: 6/10

Leaf Shield---- 8
Raining Leafs-- 4
Collision------ 8

Doc Wood Man, Like Doc Quick Man is one of the Top 5 most difficult to buster
only in my opinion, but of the Doc Robots he is probably the second hardest.
What he will do at the beginning of the fight is create a Leaf Shield around
him, during this time you cannot harm him with the buster, also as he has the
Shield on he will fire off 4 leafs into the air which will rain down, as the
leafs begin to rain down he will throw the Leaf Shield at you, at this time
you can fire a shot through the Leaf Shield, do so and then jump over it and
try to get as many hits on him as you can and repeate. Jumping over the Leaf
Shield can often times be very hard to do because you basically have to pixel
perfect the jump. It is impossible to kill him without having to slide under
him. As he throws off his third Leaf Sheild, you will have to jump over the
Leaf Shield and towards Doc Wood Man to get a little bit ahead of the game,
then go back left a little and slide under him. if you just stand in place
and try to jump over it and slide under him you will take too long and he will
jump on you, and if you don't go back to the left a little, he will hit you as
he jumps. After you get on the other side of him repeate from the right side
of the room. Try to pay attention to the Raining leafs and jump between them
as they get close to you as well.

------Doc Heat Man------

Difficulty: 7/10

Flame Pillars------- 4 (It does 4 even before they land)
Fireball Collision-- 4
Collision----------- 4

Doc Heat Man, like Heat Man in Mega Man 2 is easily predictable and abused.
He takes 1 Damage per shot but he catches himself on fire after each shot,
during this time you can't hurt him and he will turn into a ball of fire and
come at you, when he flys at you jump over him and shoot him again, then the
process will repeate itself, so just keep shooting him and jumping over him
and he will be done for. If you take too long between shots or if you are too
quick to shoot him when he comes out of being a Fireball, he won't catch
himself on fire and he will get off little fireballs around the room, just
try and jump between them as they are coming at you, once they land on the
ground they will form small flame pillars, but they aren't too hard to dodge.
Basically you have to be fast, but not too fast, because if you are too fast,
then he won't light himself on fire and charge at you, which is what you want
him to do. Try to lure him from the right side to the middle, then back to the
right, then back to the middle, then back to the right, etc. That way if you
mess up accidently you have the left side of the room to escape to.

------Doc Flash Man------

Difficulty: 6/10

Buster Shot--- 2
Collision----- 4

Doc Flash Man's big difference from the Battle against Flash Man in Mega Man 2
is the arena. At the beginning of the fight, jump onto the 2nd highest
platform on the left side, and when he comes near you jump up and over him and
then get on the highest platform and when he uses his Time Stopper, jump in
the air to avoid being hit by the shots from his Arm Cannon. He will Start
making his way back to the other side, just jump over him and jump again when
he goes to use Time Stopper, and just keep doing that until he is dead.
Sometimes jumping over the Doc Robot's can be very awkward, but keep at it.

Doc Flash Man's fight is from 4:25 - 5:05


------Doc Bubble Man------

Difficulty: 7/10

Bubble Lead--- 4
Buster Shot--- 2
Collision----- 4

Doc Bubble Man himself isn't so hard to Buster only fight. More than anything
you will have a lot of stuff to watch out for, His Bubble Lead attack which he
will launch 2 - 3 Bubbles that bounce along the ground, you can easily run or
slide under them. His Shots from his Arm Cannon as well, avoiding collision
damage is especially important because all Doc Robots do insane collision
damage, and not hitting the spikes in the ceiling make for a lot of obstacles.
Try your best to dodge all the attacks he throws at you. Bascially as I said,
to get around Bubble Lead just try to run or slide under them, to avoid his
shots it depends on where you are at. Try jumping, this will make him wait
until after he has started swimming to begin shooting and thus you can just
ignore the shots for the most part because you will have landed before he
started shooting. Don't jump too high though, otherwise you will be one hit
killed by the spikes. If he starts shooting while you are falling back to the
ground try to go between the shots, once you are between 2 of them, hold the
direction the shots are being fired to kind of move with them.
