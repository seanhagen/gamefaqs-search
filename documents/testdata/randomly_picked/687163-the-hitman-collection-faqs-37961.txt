#Beginning Notes#
#################

Did you ever want to kill every bad guy on every level? Did you ever think you
could do it without cheating? Well, you can. This walkthrough will show you in
detail how to go about doing this. You will also accomplish your goal in each
mission. Don't get discouraged if you have trouble, just try again. "Long is
the way/and hard/that out of hell/leads up to light" - Milton, Paradise Lost.
Take as much ammo as you can for each weapon. I will assume you do so
throughout this walkthrough.
If the guy is standing still and you can maneuver completely behind him, then
kill him with the knife. Otherwise, use the Fibre Wire. When using the Silenced
Beretta (and you should use the Silenced Beretta almost exclusively), shoot
guys with their backs towards you in the head twice. Shoot guys facing you in
the head/upper chest three to four times. You may kill them with the first
shot, but if you don't, you'll be glad you took the time to place extras.
While you will indeed accomplish every goal in the mission, you will be docked
so much money in some cases that you will fail regardless.
I realize that my version of Hitman is not the mainstream version of the game,
so some of the names might not match completely. Other than that, I don't think
I've played the real game, so I don't know.

#Training#
##########

Simple level. Follow the instructions given to you. As long as you take the
clothes and a handgun, all you need to do is follow the path. When you finally
go up levels in the elevator (to level 1), there will be an attendant who will
try to get you with a taser. Kill him and take his clothes. Holster your
weapons and go through the next door. Wait until the attendant has opened the
bars, then kill him as well. Open the next set of bars yourself and continue to
end this level.

#Kowloon Triads Gang War#
#########################

Background:
You have been hired to assassinate Lee Hong, leader of the Red Dragon Triad.
In this level, you must kill the Red Dragon negotiator in an effort to spark a
gang war between the Red Dragons and the Blue Lotus. Such a gang war would
weaken Lee Hong and provide a chance for his demise.

Objectives:
-Eliminate Red Dragon negotiator
-Blue Lotus negotiator must survive

Equipment:
AMT 1911 Hardballer - $550
Blaser Jagdwaffen R93 Sniper - $1550

	We begin simply by completing the mission.
Head down the street and take a right at the intersection. Follow that street
past the park and take the street left, still along the park. Duck into the
alley to your right between the buildings and use the lift to take you to the
roof. While the lift is going up, click on your Sniper's Case in your
inventory. Hitman will remove the Sniper's Rifle. Once on the roof, go to the
corner of the roof farthest from the lift but closest to the park. Drop the
rifle on the roof before you reach the corner, as citizens from the street
might see you with the rifle and alert the guards.
Wait for both negotiators to arrive, then pick up the rifle. For some reason,
nobody sees you after the negotiators have arrived. Zoom in once the
negotiators meet. The Red Dragon negotiator is on the left, closest to you.
They will bow, and then his head will be steady for a few seconds. Peg him in
the head.
Nearby guards will run to see the body. Shoot as many of the Blue Lotus
members as you can around the body, but don't shoot the Blue Lotus negotiator
(he runs back to his car, so you can't kill him later). A helicopter will be on
its way, but don't worry. Continue shooting Blue Lotus members without zooming
out on the Sniper's Rifle. There will be a cutscene with a Blue Lotus in a
helicopter taking aim. When the cutscene finishes, your crosshair will be on or
very near the Blue Lotus in the helicopter. Take him out with one shot (you
won't have time for a second).
Once the helicopter is dispatched, you can take your time. From the corner of
the roof your are on, aim towards the Blue Lotus negotiatorâ€™s car. In the
opening to the park there should be two Blue Lotus members (or you shot them
earlier). If they're there, kill them. Now aim across the park at the opening
farthest from you. Kill the two Blue Lotus members there and wait for another
Blue Lotus to appear from the street, then shoot him. Reverse of tact here,
wait for the Blue Lotus to pass on the right of the Red Dragon negotiator's
car, then pop him. The two Blue Lotus at the opening next to the car will run
to investigate (if they're not already dead); shoot them, as well.
Drop your Sniper's Rifle and head back to the lift. Hit the button and select
"Road". Face the direction of the button. When you get to the ground, if you
hear the Blue Lotus member behind you cry out, quickly strafe right and turn
around. You will be under the cover of some boxes. Lean right, around the
boxes, and kill the two Blue Lotus with your Hardballer. Head back to the lift,
facing away from the street. Now, regardless of what happened when you got off
the lift, head the direction you are facing around the building. There will be
a lone Blue Lotus member patrolling. Kill him with your Hardballer and take his
Uzi. Now, if the two Blue Lotus did not cry out and are still alive, go back
and use your brand new Uzi to dispatch them, using the boxes near the lift for
cover. Turn right on the street and locate the fallen Blue Lotus member. Near
him will be him M60. Relieve him of it, and make you way back to the car.
Although none of the opposition should be around, you are easily armed enough
to dispatch them if they are.

#Ambush at the Wang Fou Restaurant#
###################################

Background:
Now the Red Dragons are angered by the hit of their negotiator. They believe
it was a Blue Lotus hit. The Blue Lotus gang, not wanting to be in a war they
didn't start, has sent an Emissary to apologize to Lee Hong. You will kill the
Blue Lotus Emissary to make the Blue Lotus believe the Red Dragons are
retaliating. You will also kill the three Blue Lotus members sent to guard the
meeting.

Objectives:
-Eliminate Blue Lotus Emissary
-Eliminate the three Blue Lotus guards

Equipment:
Oyabun Knife - $65
Beretta 92 Silenced - $775
Car Bomb with Remote Detonator - $3000
Kevlar Body Armor - $900

Again, we begin by completing the mission. Doing this mission genocidally
prevents you from buying the Desert Eagle in the next mission.
Head through the alley in front of you to find the front of the Wang Fou
Restaurant. Wait across the street for the Emissary's car to arrive. Follow the
driver into the alley (they don't think this odd) and get behind him when he
starts to pee. When you are facing his back, there will be one civilian to pass
from your left to your right and into the side alley. Another civilian will
pass on the sidewalk on the right end of the alley. Either will see you kill
the driver, so make sure they have passed. Hit Sneak Mode and ice the driver.
Drag him into the sewer and take his clothes and gun. Holster everything, go
out of Sneak Mode, and climb out to the alley. Go back to the restaurant.
Go to the driver's door of the Emissary's car. There is a single Blue Lotus
guard walking around the car. Wait for him to go on the other side of the car.
Make sure your back is turned to the restaurant, and then take out the bomb.
Right click on the driver's door, and place the bomb.
Run back to the sewer and take your old clothes. The Emissary will leave the
restaurant, but will take a while to leave because he has no driver. Do not
take out the Remote Detonator in view of any gang members as they will see it
and kill you. Go back to the alley across from your getaway car (the starting
point). Use the Lean Right button to hide behind the building, but still watch
the three Blue Lotus members at the end of the street. When the car comes
around the corner in front of you, take out the Remote Detonator. Hit Fire when
the car would be right between the first two gang members.
If any of the three Blue Lotus members survived the blast, leave them. Turn
around and run down the street away from the Blue Lotus members. There will be
one Red Dragon wandering around the map counter-clockwise. This is the best
time to dispatch him-with your silenced Beretta from an alley. Otherwise, you
will have to do it later. At the end of the street you will find an alley off
to your right. Head to the opening of the alley and look right, down the
street. At the end of the street you will see two Red Dragon members. Head to
the end of the alley and pick up the Sniper's Rifle as well as the Sniper's
ammo. Go back to the mouth of the alley and look down the street, towards the
two Red Dragons. Kill them both, the rightmost one first.
Walk to where they fell and look towards the entrance to the restaurant.
Strafe left, towards the restaurant, until you can see one of the two Red
Dragons guarding the front. Kill them both with the Sniper's Rifle. This would
also be a good place to camp and wait for the wandering Red Dragon, if need be.
Go up to the new corpses, and liberate them of their weapons dropping the
Sniper's Rifle. Ready an Uzi and then position yourself between the two doors
that are the entrance. Open the rightmost set of doors. In front of you will be
two Red Dragons, almost in a line. Kill them with the Uzi, then drop it. Take
out the second Uzi and strafe right. If the doors close, open them. To the left
in front of the staircase is another Red Dragon who will be running to see the
trouble, so kill him. Finally, strafe back left and enter the restaurant. There
is a Red Dragon behind the door to the right, so strafe and lean left to take
him out.
At the opposite end of the restaurant is a set of double-doors with a sign
above them that says "BAR". They don't open, but to the right of these doors is
a single wooden door. Inside this door is a closet with a gaggle of Sniper's
ammo. Take at lease two clips of ammo, then go pick up the Sniper's Rifle. Go
forward through the alley and back to the place where you hid with the Remote
Detonator. Aim down the street and eliminate any remaining Blue Lotus members.
Advance down the street to the corner in front of you. There are two Red
Dragons down the street to your left on opposite sides of the street. Take out
the rightmost Red Dragon first, then his buddy. These guys pack shotguns, so
they have trouble hitting you from far away.

#The Massacre at Cheung Chau Fish Restaurant#
#############################################

Background:
The Chief of Police is on the payroll of both Triads. He has arranged a peace
meeting between the two gangs in an effort to stay on the payroll of both
Triads. You will kill the Chief of Police and leave a Red Dragon Amulet around
his body. This will make the police withdraw protection from Lee Hong and you
will be able to go after him.

Objectives:
-Eliminate Red Dragon Emissary
-Hide Red Dragon Emissary's body
-Place Red Dragon Amulet inside the restaurant
-Eliminate the Chief of Police

Equipment:
Oyabun Knife - $65
Fibre Wire - $110
Kevlar Body Armor - $900

When you start the mission, you need to turn left and head through he alley to
your left. At the end of the alley is a fence to your left. Go left past the
fence and continue all the way to the street. Turn left at the sidewalk and you
will be facing a police officer. Slit his throat and drag him back through the
alley and into the sewer. Take his Beretta and climb out.
You will be facing an alleyway a little to your left, and you need to take it.
Follow it to the street and take the alley across the street and slightly to
the right. Get behind him and cut his throat. Drag his body down the alley (the
way he came) and turn right at the alley intersection. Continue dragging him
down that alley and turn right when you can. You will be behind the restaurant.
There is a sewer grate next to you, so throw his body in there. Take his
Beretta and climb out.
Turn left and head down the alley you just used. At the intersection, continue
forward until you find the street. A civilian will pass from the right and into
the alley past you, and another will come down the street to your left and head
left, away from you. Once both civilians have passed, it is safe to slit the
throat of the Red Dragon member. Drag his body to the right and further down
the street the way he was heading. Put him in the sewer grate you find and take
his clothes and the Red Dragon Amulet.
Holster everything and climb out of the grate. Turn right and then head back
into the alley you just used. Follow this alley all the way until you find
yourself at the back of the restaurant. There will be a lone officer guarding
the back door and two more will be patrolling from the right (the brick side)
and then around through the fence to the left (clockwise). Look down the alley
to the right to assure that no officer is coming, then strangle the office
guarding the door. Be careful that his head is turned away from you so he
doesn't see you prematurely.
Holster the Fibre Wire and move away from the body (but still behind the
restaurant). When the other two officers appear, strangle them when they run up
to examine the body. Relieve them all of their Berettas, and take out two
Berettas John-Woo-style. Open door the lone officer was guarding (with the
steps). You will find yourself in the kitchen. Quickly move forward and open
the door in front of you. A bit to the right will be the Police Captain, your
target. Stay in the doorway and shoot him. Reload and lean right, aiming at the
door to the restaurant. The two officers outside will come in. When they do,
kill them.
Strafe right and lean right until you can see the Bartender, then kill him. Go
inside and drop the Red Dragon Amulet on the table. If the two officers are
still outside, shoot them through the windows. Exit through the front door of
the restaurant and take a slight right and head down the street to find your
car.

	This is easy as heck if you follow my instructions and take your time.

Take a deep breath. Head to the restaurant go inside. Head around the
centerpiece and through the doors labels "BAR". Talk to the bartender and take
the flyer he gives you. Watch the doors where you came into the bar. When they
open and the chick wearing black and carrying an Uzi comes through, go back
through the doors and shut them behind you. Hit Sneak Mode and kill the
bodyguard guarding the door to your left. Nobody will see you in this hallway
until the Uzi-toting bodyguard comes back. Drag the body into the closet (the
door he was guarding) so he cannot be seen from the hallway. Take his clothes
and his gun. Holster, come out of Sneak Mode, and exit the closet. Turn right
and press yourself against the doors to the bar. When the female bodyguard
opens the doors, shut them again and hit Sneak Mode. Quickly strangle her
before she passes the door to the closet. Take her Uzi and holster it. Drag her
body into the closet.
Turn left and head down the hallway away from the bar. Keep left and go
through the double-doors with the two bodyguards. They will welcome you because
you have the Flyer. Leave them and head up the stairs and then back down the
ramp. You will take care of them later. At the bottom, turn a hard right and
head through the tables that you find. Along the wall opposite the bottom of
the ramp is a single door. In front of this door is a guard. Cut his throat and
take his weapon. Go into the door he was guarding. It is a hallway leading off
to your left, so go left. Inside the only door you find will be several crates
and one of Lee Hong's possible safes. Sneak up behind the guard (to your left
when you enter) and strangle him. DO NOT take his clothes or try to open the
safe! Instead, you will find a door to the right of the safe (the one you
didn't use to enter) which you should open. You will find yet another door.
Holster everything and make sure you're in Sneak Mode. Open the door and strafe
left so you can only see the closest bodyguard. Take out your Silenced Beretta
and pop him (twice, see above) in the head. Another bodyguard will run from the
bottom of the ramp to the dead guard. Try to kill him when he does this. If
your door closes, stay put. The guard will come through to kill you so pop him
when he does. Open the door and strafe right. Lean right to see if you can hit
the fat guy. If you can't, continue to strafe right and then lean right until
the fat guard is dead. Take his Hardballer. Go inside the double-doors the fat
guy was originally standing in front of. They are to your left from the
single-door you just used.
Head up the stairs, through the door, and then up the stairs again until you
find a crazy looking old lady. The prostitute has run to her room in distress.
You'll comfort her later, you stud, you, but now you have work to do. Take the
leftmost door and you will find a lone Red Dragon member. Go inside the room
and take the door on your right. Go inside the hall, turn right, and then back
up. there might be a female bodyguard in the hallway in front of you. If there
is, strangle her. If not, wait for her to come through the door you just used,
then shut the door behind her and kill her. Go back into the room with the
single Red Dragon member. Turn right and head through the door you find,
shutting it behind you. You will be in the safe room. Sneak up behind the guard
and slice his throat. Drag his body into the corner so you can enter the door
you just used without the Red Dragon guy seeing his dead comrade. Back to the
lone Red Dragon member, sneak up behind him and ice him. Take his Uzi and the
SMG ammo on the table below the mirror. Drag him body onto his comrade's body
in the room with the safe. Return to the room where the lone Red Dragon member
WAS, and shut the door behind you. Open the door in front of you to find the
old lady. Talk to her, and she will walk to the room where the lone Red Dragon
member was.
You should be facing a bodyguard with an Uzi and his back to the wall. When
the old lady has left, sneak up behind him and snuff him. Move forward a bit
and take a hard left to find a bodyguard at the end of a hall, next to a door.
Get behind him and ice him, as well. Move forward and down the steps to your
left to find another lone bodyguard. Slice his throat and then open you
double-doors you should be facing (after killing the guard). You will now be
looking at the stairs down. Shut the door behind you and strangle this guy with
the Fibre Wire (you can't get completely behind him, so don't use the knife).
Back through the double-doors at the top of the stairs, up the new set of
stairs, and then through the second door on your left. You will notice you are
back in the hallway where you strangled the female guard. Turn left and move
forward past the door you used previously. Take the door you find into the
prostitute's room.
Talk to her, then follow her through the doors but not up the ladder. Once
through the last door and on the roof, wait in the alcove with the door. A Red
Dragon member will be patrolling and will stop in this alcove. Strangle him and
drag him into the corner (not with the door). Take his clothes and weapon. Go
climb the ladder the prostitute leads you to. Watch the cut scene and hit Sneak
Mode when you resume control. Sneak up behind the Red Dragon member patrolling
and strangle him. There are no other people around, so leave him and follow the
girl. Talk to her when she reaches the gate. She will give you the combination
to Lee Hong's safe and a kiss (awwwww). Love the sneer.
Go back to the Red Dragon member you strangled and take his weapon. Holster
everything and head up the stairs on the building. Go in the center door on the
platform. You will be in the kitchen. On the wall to your left, there are two
openings. The first is the freezer and the second is a set of stairs down to
the basement. Take the stairs down. Head past the first guard and turn left.
You won't have to open any doors to get to the prisoner area. Head left again
at the hallway and you will see an opening to a darker part of the basement to
your right. Take this opening and you will come up to a guard with his back to
you. Slit hit throat and leave him where he is. Turn around. There are other
openings with steps leading further into the basement. Take the leftmost one
with the guard in front of the door. Walk past the guard in front of the door
(stay as far away from him as you can) and go up the steps. Hang a left
immediately into another opening and you will be in another hallway heading off
to the right. Your only option should be to go right, so do so a bit. If you
see a Red Dragon member in this hallway, strangle him and leave his body there.
If he isn't there, he will be shortly.
Head back out the opening and past the stairs down to the lower area. Turn
right at the intersection of hallways you come to. Follow the hallways until
you find an Red Dragon member on your right. Cut his throat, and then return to
the lowered area with the lone guard and door. If you get too close, the guard
tells you to leave. Strafe behind him, hit Sneak Mode, and strangle him. Drag
his body into the door he was guarding. Drop your AK-47 next to his body. Come
out of Sneak Mode and talk to the prisoner. PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT HE SAYS. He
will tell you the location of the safe, which changes every time. Once the cut
scene is over, walk out of the room and pick up the dead guard's AK-47. Turn
left and then left through the opening once more. Turn right and go down the
hallways until you come to an intersection. Turn right and go up the stairs
(which are hard to see). Turn left and go through this hallways and then take
the stairs on your right. Wait at the top of these stairs for a Red Dragon
member. He will come through the door on your left. Once the door has shut
behind him, strangle him. On the crates in front of you you will find some AK
ammo-take it.
Go through the door the Red Dragon member just used, dragging him out of the
way if he can be seen when the door is opened. Continue down the hallway you
find through the door until it cuts to the right. When you turn right, you will
either find a Red Dragon member in front of you, or at the end of the hall to
your left. You want to strangle him when he is closest to where you are now, so
do so. Down the hall he was patrolling, you will find a single door to your
left. Open it and find an elevator and another door to the right. Open the door
to the right and cut the Red Dragon guy's throat. Holster and go through the
passage which is in front of you. Follow the passage and go across the bridge
you find. Cut the throat of the Red Dragon guy on the other end of the bridge.
Holster and continue up the steps until the hallway splits. Go left, but only a
few steps. A Red Dragon member will eventually stop in front of where you are
now. Strangle him. Follow the hallway forward and around to the right to find
another Red Dragon member in front of an elevator. Call the elevator and cut
the Red Dragon guy's throat. Holster and get on the elevator.
Take the elevator up to the VIP area. Get off the elevator and turn right.
Head through the double-doors you find, and then again through the new set, and
yet again through the new set. Eventually, a Red Dragon member will join you in
the room you find. Kill him, and then backtrack through the three sets of
doors. turn right and head down the steps into the VIP Meeting Room. GO up the
steps at the other end and back around left and stop behind the window facing
the room. Wait here and strangle the Red Dragon member that joins you. You must
wait a few seconds after he takes position, as the other guard will spin around
when the first guard is in position. Holster and go back out the opening to the
safe. Strafe left off the platform and drop behind the Red Dragon guy guarding
the safe. Strangle him. If the CIA guy told you the safe was in the VIP Meeting
Room, then open the safe and remove the Jade Figure. If he told you another
location-don't worry, we will visit each location at least once from this
moment on.
Holster everything. Exit the Meeting Room the way you came and once up the
stairs, turn right to go back to the elevator. Once inside the elevator, take
it up to the Guard's Quarters. There is a guard who patrols right in front of
the elevator, so strangle him when he walks by and leave him there. Turn right
in the hallway and you will come to a hallway intersection. To your left are
two guards guarding the safe. To your right are two guards who will alert Lee
Hong and/or kill you if they hear you kill the safe guards. Go left and into
the room with the two guards. First get behind the guard beneath the TV (to
your left), and hit sneak mode. The guard in front of the safe looks around a
lot, so try to kill the guard in front of you with the knife when the other
guard is looking away. The safe guard will look at you for a bit, then look
away for a bit. Wait until he looks back the second time (which will last a
while), and then he will look away for a while-do it then. Holster your knife
as quickly as you can and run up to the other guard. If he notices the other
guard dead, he will run over giving you the chance to sneak up behind him and
strangle him before he sounds the alarm. If he doesn't notice, strangle him and
feel lucky. Either way, work quickly. If the CIA guy told you the safe was in
the Guard's Quarters, then open the safe, take the figure, and then holster
everything.
Take the Sniper's Ammo on the table (next to the AK). Exit through the hallway
you used to enter, but move past the hallway with the elevator. You will find
yourself in a room with two Red Dragon members and another wooden table. Take
the Sniper's ammo on the corner closest to you, and then the AK ammo on the
other end. Go through the double-doors the Red Dragon guys are guarding,
shutting the doors behind you. To your left will be a lone Red Dragon guy. Cut
his throat, and then drag him with you. Open the rightmost door on the wall you
were facing when you entered this hallway. Inside this room will be some AK
ammo and two bullet-proof vests. If you need a vest, take one. Either way, take
the AK ammo.
Backtrack through the double-doors to the two guards you left. Turn left once
through the doors and move to the wall. Turn around so the two guards line up
in front of each other. Hit Sneak Mode and STAY in Sneak Mode until I say
otherwise. Quickly take out your Silenced Beretta (in Sneak Mode) and cap them
both. Leave them. Reload and then holster your weapons. Go back through the
double-doors to your right and shut them behind you. Open the single-door you
are facing. Inside you will be able to see one guard (there is another to your
right which is usually out of sight). Take out your Silenced Beretta and shoot
him in the head. His buddy will run out the door in a second or two, so shoot
him when he does. Go inside the room and take the SMG ammo on the table to your
right. Holster everything.
Back out the door and left in the hallway. The move forward to the second door
on your left. Open the door and strafe right so the leftmost guard is the only
one in your view. Again, use your Silenced Beretta to shoot his mouth off and
his friend will come running out shortly. Kill him with the Silenced Beretta
and then turn around. Reload and then holster. You will find yourself facing a
set of double-doors. If you see TWO sets of double-doors, take the leftmost
set. Though these doors turn left and open the double-doors you find. Again,
line up these two Red Dragon members so they are behind each other, and take
them out with the Silenced Beretta. Reload and then holster. Open the
double-doors you are facing. Leave the guards you find in this area alone. You
may exit Sneak Mode now, if you wish.
In front of you will be a metal walkway. Follow it and enter the door on the
other side. If the CIA guy told you the safe was in Madame's place, you're in
luck, because you're in the room with that very safe. If that was the case,
open the safe and retrieve the Jade Figure. Be sure to holster the figure and
close the safe door. Open the door you did not use to enter this room to find
Madame herself. Continue forward through the door you find and down the stairs
which are slightly to your right. At the very bottom of the stairs, go through
the double-doors. If the CIA guy told you the safe was in the storage room,
then take the single door on the wall to your right. Go through the door you
find and you will find the safe to your right. Holster the figure and the
return through both single doors. Regardless of the safe location, go up the
ramp in front of you and turn right when you must. Open the double-doors at the
bottom of the stairs. Enter Sneak Mode and shoot the female bodyguard to your
left with the Silenced Beretta. This will bring the male bodyguard from the
right. If the doors shut, however, he will run for Lee Hong. If you let him get
away, you will have to kill him later (not described in this walkthrough, but
he returns to his post in a few minutes). Either way, you must kill him with
the Silenced Beretta. Reload and holster your weapons.
Go through the double-doors and turn right to head back through the
double-doors that say "BAR." Slightly to your left will be another set of
double-doors, so enter them. Ahead of you is another set, so enter them. Talk
to the old man. After your conversation, leave the poison and run back the way
you came to the Brothel (Madame's). Tzun is making his way inside the
restaurant, and if he sees you, he will notice that you are an imposter and
your cover will be blown! Run all the way back to the brothel and take the door
to the roof (the one the prostitute showed you). Just outside the door is an
alcove, will be where you kill the Red Dragon member. Take your bodyguard
clothes back and empty your hands. Go out onto the roof where there will be
another Red Dragon member patrolling and two Red Dragon members guarding a door
at the far side of the roof. Strangle the patrolling Red Dragon out of sight of
the other two Red Dragons, behind the brick structure in the middle. Holster
everything.
Go behind the two Red Dragons guarding the double-doors. Hit Sneak Mode.
Deftly, whip out your Silenced Beretta and shot the leftmost Red Dragon in the
back of the head. Quickly turn and shoot his comrade to the right as well. If
either guy shoots, area guards will be prematurely alarmed. Walk off the raised
platform you are on and turn left to find the skylight on the ground (you're on
the roof, remember?). As you approach it, there will be some electrical
equipment to your right. Stay close to the equipment (it doesn't hurt you) so
nobody in the restaurant can see you. Take out your Uzi (thanks to your effort
up to this point, you should have a generous supply of ammunition) and slowly
walk up to the skylight. Shoot Lee Hong as soon as you can hit him, and then
advance a little further to try to take out Tzun. A bodyguard will come through
the rightmost double-doors, so kill him. Another comes through the golden
double-doors to your left, so kill him. Move counter-clockwise around the
skylight until you are pressed up against the brick building and barely not
falling in the skylight. You should see another bodyguard near the corner of
the wall. Kill him. Another bodyguard will come to investigate, so kill him.
Move back to where you shot Lee Hong. Civilians will be running in and out of
the double-doors. When the doors are open, shoot outside a couple times to
alert the guards. You want to kill two more bodyguards, both entering from the
middle double-doors (leftmost red). Take care to avoid civilians, they cost you
$3000 a kill, and falling in the skylight, which kills you instantly.
Move to the skylight on the opposite side of the electrical equipment. You
should be able to kill two more bodyguards through this skylight. One is
between the doors to the kitchen, and the other is next to the red double-doors
(to your left, on approach from the other skylight). You won't have trouble
finding them-they'll probably shoot first. Kill them both.
Go back to the raised platform with the double-doors. Open the double-doors
and you will find the two guards you previously shot on your right. On the wall
to your left will be a single door. Open this door and turn right once inside.
In front of you will be a Sniper's Rifle. Pick it up. Exit this room and take
the double-doors to your left. Take the new double-doors on the right and then
turn left and take the double-doors on the left. Move forward and go down the
steps to the right. Turn left and pass in front of the elevator. On the crates
to your left you will find two clips of Sniper's Ammo. Take them. Past the
crates will be a single door. Open the door and strafe right until you can
shoot the Red Dragon members with the Sniper's Rifle (you can sometimes line
them up to get them both in one shot). Kill them. Let the door shut behind you.
For some reason, the Red Dragons don't see you up here. Facing the direction
you would be having just exited the door, look down and left. You will notice
some stairs. Watch the stairs until a red dragon member comes from the right
(from a hallway you can barely see) and stops on the stairs. Ice him with the
Sniper's Rifle. Another Red Dragon member will come from the right, and another
from the left. You REALLY want to kill the one on the right, or you will be in
a head-on confrontation later. Kill the one on the left as well as the one that
run from the bottom-right of the screen. Unzoom.
Looking a bit more right, you should see two Red Dragons standing next to each
other in a sort of alcove. Kill them both, but don't kill any Red Dragons this
brings. Walk down the walkway to the other door. Turn around and look down and
right. Zoom in on the Red Dragon guarding the double-doors. Kill him. This will
bring a Red Dragon from the right, and another (eventually) from the
bottom-left. Kill them both. The VIP area is now secure.
If you left the Red Dragon member I mentioned above that you REALLY want to
kill, you're not SOL yet. If you DID kill him, skip this paragraph. Go back to
the elevator and take it down to the basement. Drop the Sniper's Rifle in the
elevator. Turn right in the basement, and follow the hallway. Go across the
little bridge and follow the hallway on the other side up the stairs and to the
right. In front of you should be a wooden door. Open it and call the elevator.
Take the elevator up to the VIP area, hit Sneak mode, and strangle the Red
Dragon. Look left to find the golden double-doors mentioned in the next
paragraph.
Go back to the elevator and take it down to the VIP level. Drop the Sniper's
Rifle in the elevator. Take out your Uzi and proceed to the alcove with the
dead Red Dragons (hard left, past the fountain). Inside the alcove will be a
hallway leading off with some wooden steps that go nowhere. Continue down the
hall you find to your right (past the elevator) to the golden double-doors.
Strafe as far left as you can and open the doors. Lean right and shoot the
bodyguard you find in the back of the head with your Silenced Beretta. Another
bodyguard will come from the opposite set of doors, so wait for him. Shoot him
before the doors shut, if you can. If they do shut, wait for him to come
through, then ice him.
Go back to the elevator with the Sniper's Rifle (you may have to call the
elevator). Pick it up, but bring out the Silenced Beretta as your primary
weapon (make sure the clip is full). Exit the elevator and turn right. Go
through the three sets of double-doors again and turn left once through the
third set. You will find a large, red set of double-doors. Strafe as far right
as you can and open the doors, facing left, towards the center of the doors.
There will be a bodyguard to the left of the doors, so shoot him in the head.
Go through the double-doors and ready your Sniper's Rifle. Stay as close to the
double-doors as you can. Point the rifle to the right, at the large set of red
double-doors you see. Guarding these doors will be a bodyguard. Take him out
with the Sniper's Rifle. Unzoom.
Now point the Sniper's Rifle on the leftmost tower (red, pointed roof, across
the garden from you). Shoot the Red Dragon guy in the tower. Strafe left, and
repeat with the guard in the right tower. Run down the path on your left and
follow it to the large, red double-doors on the other end of the garden (first
one you come to on the path). Open these doors and look left. Using the
Sniper's Rifle, shoot the two guards in front of Lee Hong's Headquarters. This
can bring guards from the Headquarters (even if the doors are locked). You
could have a chance to kill at least two guards from inside the headquarters.
After no guards have appeared for about 30 seconds, continue through the doors
and look left. Walk forward until you can see the Red Dragon member on the dock
below you. Shoot him with the Sniper's Rifle, as well. Finally, you can drop
the Sniper's Rifle.
Turn right and locate the red double-doors on the brick building. These go
back into the restaurant. Whip out that Uzi and make sure the clip is full,
you'll need your ammo. Head to the golden double-doors and open them. Follow
the wall past the kitchen doors and open the golden double-doors. Open the
single door on the wall to your left. Kill the guard in front of the door in
it's own niche. Go inside and strafe right using the wall to your left as
protection. Another bodyguards is in the room to your left. Reload and follow
the signs to the restrooms. Shoot the bodyguard you find there, catching him
off-guard. Exit the restroom area (via the ONLY golden door) and turn right.
Take the rightmost door to enter the kitchen. Be careful, there is a bodyguard
to your right (kinda hidden behind the stuff on the wall to your right). Take
him out with the Uzi as well, then reload. Holster.
Exit the kitchen doors and make sure there are no stragglers-you're almost
finished, but the grunt work is not yet over. Turn right and exit through the
red double-doors. Go up to Lee Hong's Headquarters and liberate one of the
guards you shot earlier of his clothes and AK-47. The doors to the Headquarters
will be locked (you wouldn't want to go in, anyway), so go back to the kitchen.
Using the opening to the left of the recently expired bodyguard, go back into
the basement. The guards won't be looking for a suspicious Red Dragon member,
so you can surprise the two Red Dragons you find by shooting them several times
with your brand new AK-47. If you're afraid of being shot, hide behind the
opening to the left and lean right, into the opening. Shoot the one guard, and
kill the other when he comes to investigate.
Reload your weapon and go down the steps to open the wooden door in front of
you. Run forward and hide in the corner with the small wall to your right. Turn
right and lean right to look down the hall. Using the AK-47, shoot the two Red
Dragons at the end of the hall. Order doesn't matter, they'll both be dead soon
enough. Continue down this hall and across the bridge until you find an
elevator. Take the elevator down to "Basement 2".
Cut the throat of the guard with his back to you and leave him there. Continue
through the only opening in this room into a smaller room where there is an
opening to a long hallway. At the end of the hallway are two guards. One of
them patrols to the opening of the room where you are. When he does, sneak up
behind him and strangle him, then go kill his buddy (do this silently so as not
to alert his friends upstairs). Call the elevator, holster everything, and then
make the AK-47 your primary weapon. Take the elevator to "Floor 1" and make
sure your gun is reloaded.
Go up the stairs in front of you when the elevator opens. Follow them to the
top and turn left. Take the leftmost opening where you can see a Red Dragon
member. Take cover behind the wall but directly in front of the Red Dragon guy.
Now comes the most difficult part. With your AK-47, shoot the Red Dragon in
front of you in the face. Strafe and lean left out of the opening. Shoot the
two Red Dragons running towards you. Reload quickly and run towards the top of
the stairs. Shoot and Red Dragons that come up the stairs as they won't suspect
you until they directly see you shooting. Stay in the opening at the top of the
stairs and lean left to kill the Red Dragons running up to investigate.
Reload and wait for a few seconds, then go down the stairs. At the bottom of
the stairs, take a hard left. Still, the remaining guys won't (read: shouldn't)
suspect you, so you should take your time. Shoot the Red Dragon member you find
at the end of the hallway. There will be one guy in front of the front doors to
the Headquarters (to the left of the guy you just shot), and then one more in
the hallway opposite the one you are in. Depending on your massacre on the
stairs earlier, one or both of the hallway Red Dragons may have been previously
eliminated. Kill these remaining Red Dragons and then check the Headquarters
once more.
Go back to the elevator. Facing the elevator, turn left to find the black
grate-looking door. Open the door and take the lift down to the dock. ONCE, I
had a Red Dragon guy on the dock that I had to shoot (he didn't suspect me), so
be prepared in case that happens. Head to the boat and escape. Congratulations,
you were the only survivor of the day (except the innocents). Oh, and you can
exhale now.

#Find the U'wa Tribe#
#####################

Background:
Your next target is Pablo Belisario Ochoa, a Columbia drug lord. In this
mission, you will enlist the help of a local tribe to find Pablo's secret camp.
A plane has crashed in this area with a Holy Figure. Bring the Holy Figure to
the tribe, and they will help you find the drug lord.

Objectives:
-Secure Holy Figure
-Bring Figure to tribal village
-Free the Chief's brother

Equipment:
Oyabun Knife - $65
Fibre Wire - $110
Beretta 92 - $475
Kevlar Body Armor - $900

The size of this map alone brings trouble both giving and following
directions. If you alarm the guards, then ALL of the guards on the levels will
see through your costume. Use the map, screw the compass.

When you start out, run forward and to the left. You will eventually come upon
a trench in the jungle. Follow the trench left, watching the side of the trench
on which you started. You will find a group of four soldiers walking across the
trench. The first three stop in the trench and look around, and the last one
stays above the trench. Sneak up behind the latter, and strangle him. This is
the only way to get a uniform without being discovered by the other soldiers.
Steal his uniform and his gun. Make sure you take the uniform of a solder
(Crocodile Dundee hat, not baseball cap). Shoot the other guards with the
Beretta.
Using your map, locate the crash site. It is at the center of the yellow
marker on your map. On your way from where you should be and the crash site,
there will be two soldiers (probably on your left). Kill them with the AK, and
take one of theirs. Try to get to the crash site before the soldiers, so you
can take the Holy Figure (although it really doesn't matter). Stand where you
would pick up the Holy Figure, and wait. A guard will walk in from the left and
stand in front of you. He is the last soldier to get into place when they are
securing the crash site. Kill him with the knife, and pick up the Holy figure,
if you have not.
Go around to the other side of the plane (either way) and climb up on the
plane using the wing. Continue up the wing and behind the soldier on top. Cut
his throat. Go back down to where the Holy Figure was.
Sneak up behind the leftmost soldier and strangle him. Then, retreat again
back to where the Figure was. One-by-one, the soldier surrounding the plane
will discover a dead soldier. They will pause, stand up and put their hands up
to their face (as though they are deep in thought...). Then they will turn
around and run towards the body. You must strangle each one while they are
running, a little before they reach the body. You are trying to prevent the
other guards from becoming alarmed. If you find yourself in a fire-fight,
restart the mission-trust me.
As flimsy as that sounds, it is an effective and easy method of dispatching
the soldiers. Run South (use your map) until you reach the river. Turn right
and run along the river until you  find the bridge. There are three soldiers at
the foot of the bridge, three more, further down the bridge, and one in the
guard tower to your right.
Climb the guard tower and hit Sneak Mode. Before you eliminate the soldier,
grab the ammo for the Sniper's Rifle that just HAPPENS to be lying in the
tower. DO NOT, however, take the Rifle (the guard will turn and shoot your ass
off). Wait for the helicopter to pass over the bridge going in the direction of
the village (left). Once it is out of sight, you only have about a minute
before it comes back. Cut the throat of the soldier, take his M60 and quickly
turn around, but stay in place and don't move towards the bridge. The three
soldiers at the foot of the bridge will now be upset with you. Show them the
true meaning of peace (the absence of people shooting you) and when they are
down, grab the Sniper's Rifle. Kill the three guards on the bridge and the one
in the guard tower opposite you. This will free the Chief's brother.
Now comes the most difficult part. Drop down from the guard tower and take one
of the dead soldier's AK-47s. Follow the Chief's brother (the prisoner) through
the jungle. He will run past almost every remaining soldier on the map. When
you come to them, dispatch them with your  AK and take one of theirs (the
brother hits the deck every time shots are fired, so you have time). Eventually
you will happen upon two guards guarding an ammo stash, so make sure you take
the ammo.
Once you arrive at the village, take out the Holy Figure and head south
without entering the village. Holster the Figure and ready your AK. Run back
along the river to the right. You will come upon two soldiers to your right.
Kill them, take one of their AKs, and head back to the village.
Back at the village, take out the Figure, and go find the Chief in the center.
There will be a cutscene with you handing over the Figure, and then another
with the Chief, and you will be in the next mission. A good thing your health
and armor get restored at the beginning of the next mission.

#The Jungle God#
################

Background:
The Chief tells you of a hidden passage to Pablo's camp. Find the hidden
passage to go kill Pablo.

Objectives:
-Find the hidden passage to Pablo's camp

Equipment:
None available

From the bridge at which you start, head forward. Kill the two soldiers in
front of you with you AK, and take one of theirs. Turn and face the bridge.
Head right, around the ruins (or whatnot). Nobody will shoot at you provided
you are wearing a soldier's uniform, so don't worry. Stay outside the ruins and
follow around the outside until you come to a wall you cannot pass. On the
other side of the wall is a bloody platform.
Find a way to the platform (there are several places where the wall is
crumbling around you), but do not go onto the platform. Instead, turn away from
it, and go left. You should see a sort of temple with two statues (probably of
Jaguars). Take the steps up to the temple and kill the two soldiers with your
AK. In the center of the grassy area on top of the temple is a hole. Drop down
and drop your AK. Continue down the hole and take the M16A2 and all the ammo.
You are now heavily armed enough to take out a third-world country.
Continue down the hole and you will come out of an opening. Go forward, and
you will see some soldiers. Shoot them. Shooting them brings all of the other
soldiers from the map, so shoot them, when they arrive. You really do make
quick work of them.
You now have two options. Since you no doubt took some damage, you don't want
to mess with the stupid Jaguar. You can either drag a dead soldier to the
bloody platform, or just shoot to damned thing. Shooting it, however, pisses
off the natives. If you're not entirely lazy, just drag a soldier. Once the
Jaguar starts munching away, waltz past and into the tunnel. Thank God for the
restoration of health and armor!

#Say Hello to My Little Friend#
###############################

##Not Genocidal##
Alright. First you must kill the two guards to the right of where you start on
the map. You can safely kill them right after the three guards pass. Continue
around the compound and kill the next two guards you come to at the corner of
the compound.
Now go and kill Pablo, as described below. Once you exit the house, turn right
on the road instead of left. You must kill the guards in the towers. The best
(quickest) way is with the knife. You must be very careful that there are no
other guards around. The patrolling guards is the number one reason you will
mess this up. When the road ends, you will see a guard tower to your right. Go</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
up and kill the guard.
Continue east (left on the map) and kill the guards in the next three towers.
At this point, you will be at the fence of the drug lab. Go south and kill the
guard in the tower you find. Then east again to that tower. East past the drug
lab entrance, and then north to the tower in the corner. Back south past the
drug lab fence to the tower. Go west between the two roads and get the two
towers there. The closest tower has a load of Sniper's Ammo, so take it. The
southeast to the two towers in the big niche in the fence (east of the
entrance)-order doesn't matter. Go through the entrance and kill the guard in
the sunken bunker-his friends surprisingly won't see you as long as the
_PATROLLING_ guards aren't about. Back in through the entrance, and then west
to the tower. Now go back to the very first tower you climbed. There are three
towers south of this one. After that, the towers are done.
Now go place the bomb in the drug lab as described below. Your only obligation
left is to kill the patrolling guards. Go out of the entrance to the drug lab
and turn right. Climb the tower you find. There's a Sniper's Rifle and some
ammo up there. Take the ammo first. Get the Sniper's Rifle and aim outside the
camp. For some reason, guards tend to not shoot you when you're in the tower.
Kill the two guards there. Then, kill the guards patrolling the outside of the
compound. The groups of three soldiers travel in twos... one group about 200
paces behind the other. There are three groups of the two groups traveling
around the outside. There is one group traveling around the drug lab, at least
two groups traveling around the airstrip, and at least three going around the
rest of the inner compound. There are also two houses with three soldiers
standing outside-one outside the front entrance, and one outside the drug lab
entrance. After that, the only soldiers left are the three in front of the
hanger.
As you can probably tell, I've not yet made it that far. I usually get caught
killing soldiers in the towers... and I have such little patience. You'll need
a better weapon than a Sniper's Rifle to take out the soldiers you can't shoot
from the tower. The tent south of the mansion (where you got the AK ammo) has
two M16A2s which are nice, but you might run out of ammo. My suggestion is the
tent west of the tent with the M16A2s, which has a bunch of Machine Gun ammo
and a Minigun *grin*. Yes, life is good.
	Below is the normal walkthrough.

Background:
You must now kill Pablo and destroy his drug lab. Naturally, Pablo keeps an
explosive on his desk, so perhaps you can liberate it from him.

Objectives:
-Eliminate the Drug Lord
-Blow up the laboratory

Equipment:
None available

When you begin, you are crawling out of the hidden passage. Shortly in front
of you and to the left is a crate containing some knives and some body armor.
Take the armor if you need it, and head right. Walk around the camp until you
find the entrance (there is only one). walk around the arm in front of the
entrance. Follow the road from the entrance keeping left  at the first
intersection. At the second intersection, you will find Pablo's mansion. Turn
right at the intersection and then go left to enter the first tent. This tent
has two M16A2s (that you can't carry) and a BUNCH of AK ammo. Grab the ammo
before heading to the mansion. Throughout the mansion, make sure to liberate
the soldiers of their Desert Eagles. Go back out of the tent to the road and
turn right.
You will see a cut scene of Pablo doing cocaine. Keep following the road to go
around to the back of the house (opposite the double-doors). There are two
decks around the mansion, one of which has two soldiers standing beside the
stairs (front of house) and the other is unguarded (back, where you should be).
Take the steps of the unguarded one, but do not open the door you end up
facing. Instead, turn right and follow the deck to another door. When you open
this door, there is a soldier behind it. Don't kill him yet. Walk past him and
turn left to find another soldier. Turn right and you will see a single door at
the end of a hallway. This door does not lead back outside. Enter the door and
there will be a lone guard in the room. Hit Sneak Mode, strangle him, and hide
his body out of view of the door you just entered.
Return to the two guards you previously left unharmed, and strangle them both
(order doesn't matter-although I have noticed that if you leave the door open
in front of the guard, he doesn't hear you kill the other guy). Behind the
guard not guarding the door is a hallway. Follow the hallway past the
double-doors to another single door. Inside you will find a guard infatuated
with the sink. Ice him and leave through the door to his right. Do not kill the
guard you are now behind. Instead, turn a hard left and open the door to the
right of the one you just came through. Kill this guard and go back into the
main area with the staircase.
Facing the first floor double-doors that are between the stairs, go right up
the stairs. Take the first door on your left. Strangle the guard and take his
Silenced Beretta and the ammo. Go to the door from which you did not enter.
Open this door, strangle the guard, and drag him into the previous room. Now,
exit through the room where there are no bodies.
Walk past the guard (he might say something to you) and take the last single
door on the left. SKIP THE DOUBLE-DOORS and the next single door! In this room
there are no guards, just a ladder. Take the ladder up and kill the guard you
find there. Take his clothes and exchange his weapon for yours if it is
different, you should now be wearing the baseball cap uniform. Climb back down
and go to the only single door on the second floor you skipped-it should be the
bathroom. Close the door behind you and strangle the guard. Ready your AK-47
and open the door.
Shoot the guard in front of the double-doors in the head. His death will bring
the guard on the first floor up toe investigate. Shut the door and wait for the
warning that guards found a dead soldier. Open the door shoot this guard. His
death will bring all the guards in this area you left alive. Using the same
method of open the door, shoot, close the door, mow them down. By my count,
there will be four total soldiers in addition to the one in front of the
double-doors. Explore the house to make sure all of the soldiers inside are
dead. Now, gather two of the AK-47s and AK-103s the guards dropped. Drop them
to the left of the second floor double-doors, so you can get them and be out of
sight.
Now, go open the double-doors on the second level. As soon as the cut scene is
over, strafe left behind the wall. Use the Lean Right key to shoot Pablo. Every
time you hit him, he will pause to insult you. You will need to shoot him
several times before he dies. If you need more bullets (you shouldn't), grab
one of the gun you dropped. After he calls you a "Son of a Puta," he will die.
Take great care not to shoot the windows behind him. If you do, guards from
several other areas will be alarmed and you are in quite a bit of trouble. Grab
the bomb on his desk. Go back to the room with the ladder. Climb the ladder and
take back your old uniform. Take back your old gun if it's a different type
than the one you have. You should be wearing the standard soldier uniform
(Crocodile Dundee hat) and you should have an AK-47.
Exit the mansion from the door you used to enter. Make sure the body in front
of the door isn't visible, and nobody should be shooting at you. Turn left and
find the road. At the road, again turn left and follow it until the road
intersects another. Turn right at the intersection and follow this road to the
drug lab. On your right will be some tents. Go inside the second tent to find a
bullet-proof vest and a Silenced Beretta with ammo. Take the Beretta and the
ammo (and the vest if you need it), and continue on the road. You will want to
enter the lab from the right side, so head right once you duck under the
arm-thing. There will be a set of concrete stairs to your left so take them
down. The two guards on the landing will tell you to go away. Make sure you
have descended the stairs enough that the guards patrolling can't see you. Take
out the Silenced Beretta and shoot the two soldiers in the head. One more will
be further down the stairs to the left, so lean around the corner and take him
out as well. This will only alarm one guard inside the lab.
Open the door and go inside to the second door. Again, hug the left of the
door against the wall. Lean Right, ready your Silenced Beretta, and open the
door. Shoot everyone inside. Even though there are several guards in this area,
you should be able to kill them all without them attacking you.
Once everyone is dead, go inside and check for survivors. A soldier likes to
hide behind the crates to your left, so strafe your way into the room so you
won't be surprised. There are also two guards through the opening in front of
you that don't seem to notice their friends being slaughtered. If you can get
by without them being alarmed, then simply walk past them. Nearby guards won't
be running to help for some reason, so take out the bomb and right click on the
crates you find. Place the bomb there. Take the uniform of an officer, the
baseball cap uniform and EMPTY YOUR HANDS of all weapons, or the guards at the
plane will shoot you. Exit through the opening and turn left to find the road.
Now, run back to the mansion using the road. Again, the guards shouldn't be
tipped off and shouldn't start shooting you. On the opposite side of the
mansion is a metal hanger with a plane, which is your escape point. Follow the
road to the left around the mansion. Go around to the front of the hanger (you
arrive at the back), and you'll find three guards in front of the plane. One of
them will run up to you and tell you to leave. Whip out a Silenced Beretta or
two and teach them to keep their mouths shut. Take out the Remote Detonator,
blow the lab, right click on the plane, select "Fly Plane", and be happy the
mission is finally over.

	**NOTE**
-I found a glitch in my version of the game. If you try to use the Remote
Detonator before you bring it out all the way, the game will crash. Make sure
you wait a second between bringing out the detonator, and using it. It really
sucks to make it this far in the mission, only to be brought down by something
that isn't your fault.

##Not Genocidal##
I've just simply not written down the instructions for this. It's easy,
though. Shoot the bodyguard outside of Fuchs' room with the Silenced Luger (use
the ammo trick described in the notes to load up on ammo). Holster the Luger,
wait for a guard to come, shoot him, repeat. There are four sections of the
hotel you do this with. However, with so much movement in the hotel, it is hard
to write a walkthrough that would stay consistent.
	Below is the regular walkthrough.

Background:
You are to eliminate the terrorist Frantz Fuchs and retrieve a chemical weapon
he has placed in the hotel.

Objectives:
-Eliminate Frantz Fuchs
-Secure Terrorist Bomb

Equipment:
Fibre Wire - $110
Kevlar Body Armor - $900

Those of you wanting to bring other weapons such as the knife along with you
should note that there are several metal detectors scattered throughout the
hotel. You cannot bring any other equipment (with the exception of the Sniper's
Rifle) into the hotel. That being said, this is the coolest mission in the
whole game. You finally feel like a hitman, not a gunman.

Go through the front doors of the hotel. Head right along the ground floor and
go through the doors to the right of the staircase. Turn right and you will
find yourself in the changing room. Open the rightmost changing room and take
the bathing suit. Shut the door behind you and then take your Fibre Wire.
Holster it (where does he put it?) and go back into the changing room. Head
right through the doors and then left into the pool area. Keep right along the
wall and go into the alcove on the right. Strangle the man in the bikini you
find there if you can. If he is already sitting in the sauna, turn the handle
just outside the sauna in the alcove to kill him. Go to his body and take the
X-Ray room key. Leave the body there.
Go back to your street clothes and change into those. Get back to the lobby of
the hotel and go up the main staircase. Keep right and go through the metal
detector. Again keep right and go through the two sets of double-doors. In this
hallway, there is a guard standing in front of a door. This is Frantz Fuchs'
room. Go to a room where a bellboy is cleaning and take the Master Key from the
door (bellboys are all over the hotel). Nobody cares when you do this. This
will also send the bellboy back down to the front desk to get another key.
Go into the room to the right of the guarded room and go onto the balcony.
Turn left and watch the adjacent balcony. A guard will come out and stretch.
He'll look around a bit, and then go back inside. Once he is back inside, walk
all the way to the end of the balcony to make Hitman jump to the other balcony
(the only place you jump like this in the game). Hit sneak Mode and get out
your Fibre Wire. Open the door and sneak up behind the guard who seems
infatuated with the mirror (he must be narcissistic). Strangle him and drag his
body into the corner so it cannot be seen when the door to the room is opened.
Take all the items on the desk (Sign, room key, and Silenced Luger) and the
bodyguard's clothes and Desert Eagle.
Open the door to the hallway (across from the balcony). Get in Sneak Mode and
take out the Sign. Right click on the door handle and place the sign. When the
sign is on the door and the door is closed, the hotel staff won't enter the
room. Strangle the bodyguard when the coast is clear (lean out and look around
the hall). If you are seen, just shut the door quickly. If you weren't seen,
drag the guard in the room and shut the door. You can also shut the door during
the strangle animation, which will cause the body to pop inside. Either way,
take out your Luger and open the door to the bathroom (only other door in the
room). Shoot Frantz in the head; he'll be in the shower to your left. Go back
out into the room and take the briefcase-looking Bomb Case. Take your street
clothes back (if you were seen, they'll be looking for a bodyguard) and jump to
the balcony of the previous room.
Go out the other hotel room and into the hallway. Turn left immediately and
choose the single door. This will take you onto a balcony which goes to the
other side of the hotel. Continue across the balcony and go into the door your
find. Head left and up the stairs you find following the signs to the Dentist
office. At the top of the stairs you will find some double-doors. Once through
these doors, you will find some orange doors to your right. Go through them and
onto the roof. Turn left and walk off the roof path. You will climb over the
center divider and then climb back down. Keep left. You will see an open window
on your left. Go into this window and your will find a bodyguard staring out
the window. You can be as noisy as you would like killing him, nobody can hear.
Go left and through those double-doors. Quickly go into the X-Ray room which
is in front of you and pick up the bomb. Go back out of the window (don't kill
the guard at the open door, that will only cause trouble). Get back to the path
on the roof and turn right (they way you came). Open the orange doors and head
right. Turn left before the set of double-doors at the end of the hall to find
another set of double-doors. Enter those doors and go past the guard to the set
of double-doors you find. In this hallway, turn right. You will see some
dumbwaiters on your right (square wooden things on the wall). Past those and on
your right is a little hallway with a single wooden door. The open the door to
find the stairs. Go all the way to the bottom floor and open he door. Turn left
in the little hallway (as if you had a choice), and then turn right and head to
the back of the kitchen. In front of you will be a pair of orange double-doors.
Through the doors and down the steps on the left to a cut scene where you are
picked up and on to the next mission.

	**NOTE**
-If you don't kill Fritz Fuchs in the Sauna (before he gets in the pool), you
will have to go ask his secretary where he is. Follow the signs to the dentist
and ask the lady behind the desk. He will either be in the Sauna, the Casino,
or the Dining Room. Strangle Fritz when he goes into the bathroom.
-If you kill a police officer, you get docked $5000, but you can take the
uniform and walk through metal detectors without setting them off (must be a
clothes-scanning metal detector).
	-You cannot put the "Do Not Disturb" sign on any other door than Fuchs'.
-If you want to hide a body, hide it in the bathroom of a close hotel room.
The bellboys don't clean the bathrooms and apparently the guests never use them
(the bathrooms).
-You must put the bomb in the bomb case provided in Fuchs' room. If you do
not, guards will shoot you.
-Want to "borrow" the Master Key? If you take the Master Key when the bellboy
is also reaching for the key, the key will be in your possession until the
bellboy opens another room (uses the key). You can snag the key near Fuchs'
room, use it to open the door you need, and that way the bellboy won't have to
go get another key and therefore spend much more time in the hall. Neat trick.
Of course, if you want to exit through the door that is not Fuchs', you find it
is locked if you don't have the Master Key.
-If you want to bring along ammunition, purchase the cheapest guns you can and
all the ammo you can carry. When you begin the level, walk up against the hotel
so the guards can't see you. Drop your weapons (except, of course, the Fibre
Wire). You ammo will stay with you. The only kind of ammo that matters is the
Beretta 92 ($475) which supplies for the Silenced Luger and all other Beretta
92s (standard police issue), the Desert Eagle ($1200) which only supplies
Desert Eagles (standard bodyguard weapon), and the shotgun, which you cannot
buy.
-There is only one weapon in this level that is not a handgun-it's a Shotgun.
To get it, kill Fuchs and take his room key from the table (to the left of the
Silenced Luger). Drop your weapons and the bomb case in the other room and go
back down to the front desk. Get your mail by talking to the hotel clerk and
take the letters he places on the counter. Back up to the room where your
weapons are and then across the balcony as described above. Instead of turning
left to the Dentist, turn right and go to the flower shop. Talk to the guy
there, and he will give you a Shotgun in a Flower Box. You can walk around the
hotel with it in the Flower Box and nobody can tell. However, it DOES set off
metal detectors and it takes about two seconds for you to bust out the Shotgun.
You also cannot carry the bomb case and the Flower Box at the same time, so
it's rather useless.
-An alternate way to get into Fuchs' room is under the guise of a bellboy.
This is very hard to feat to accomplish. First, steal a Master Key from one of
the other bellboys when he is in a room. Then, go up the main stairs in the
lobby and turn left at the landing. Go through the metal detector and turn left
in the hall you enter. After the corner in the wall to the right, turn right
and enter the double-doors to find yourself in the "Conference Room" (as it is
marked by a sign). Continue to the other end of the room and enter the
double-doors you find. In this hall, turn left and go into the door that has
the "Authorized Personnel" sign on it. You must have the Master Key to open
this door. Inside you will find a bellboy uniform. For added authenticity
(although it is not required), you can go grab a towel from the Men's Changing
Area. Turn right when you enter the first set of green double-doors to find a
wooden door; inside of which you will find three towels. Go to Fuchs' room and
talk to the bodyguard. You will tell him you are brining fresh towels. Once
inside, move quickly-you really have only ten seconds until the guard inside
throws you out. Grab the Silenced Luger on the table, pop the guard inside, and
turn to shoot the other guard as he comes in the door. Then go into the
bathroom and shoot Fuchs. This must be EXTREMELY well-timed if you expect not
to get caught.
-There is also an alternate way of escape through the front doors. A limo
drives up, you jump in, and it speeds off. It looks much cooler, but you have
to walk through a metal detector. After you pick up the bomb and head back out
the Dentist's window, head across the roof to the path. Turn left (the way you
didn't come), instead of right, and go in these orange doors. Turn left and
move forward through the double-doors. You will be in a hallway with only one
door, to your right. Open it to find the stairs. Go all the way down and open
the door at the bottom. Follow the hallway you find yourself in, through two
sets of double-doors. Once through the second set, turn right and go through
the double-doors your find there. Open another set a few feet in front of you,
and keep going forward into the lobby. Turn left and go out the way you came
in. Run through the metal detector to cue the cut scene.

#Gunrunner's Paradise#
######################

Background:
You must kill Arkadij Jegorov ("Boris"), the man who was supplying the Triads
and the drug lord with weapons. First you must find him, however. There is an
arms deal between Boris and a Dutch gang going down. You must pose as a gang
member and place a tracking device on the money meant for Boris. This will tell
you where Boris is hiding.

Objectives:
-Place GPS tracker on gang car
-Move GPS tracker to money suitcase
-Give the suitcase to Ivan

Equipment:
Fibre Wire - $110
Kevlar Body Armor - $900
GPS Receiver - $0
GPS Transmitter - $4000
Heckler & Kotch MP5SD - $2700 (Buy as much ammo as it will let you-you'll need
it)

Timing this the way I did is best-work fast. Also make sure you don't reload
your Uzi-that will waste ammo. Instead, just drop the used Uzi and take the Uzi
of the gang member(s) you kill. This doesn't change much from the regular
walkthrough.

From the starting point, move forward and right until you reach some train
tracks. You should be able to see a lone gang member walking in front of you.
He has no visible weapon and doesn't seem to mind that you are there with him.
Sneak up behind him and ice him for his ignorance. Go switch the tracks, the
switch should be behind you. Now take the gang member's clothes and gun. Drag
his body to a dark area next to the fence which should be to your right.
Holster everything but take the Uzi out so it is visible (it's the standard
visible weapon).
Follow the tracks to the left-the way the arrow should be pointing. Before
long you will find a boarding platform. Continue past it and switch the switch
farthest from you. Turn around and head back to the platform. Turn left at the
platform and head forward. You will see an orange car parked in front of a
building. There is a gang member standing next to the building, watching the
car. Go in the door to the left of him and you will be in the strip club.
Talk to the bartender. He will arrange a backstage meeting between you and the
stripper. Go in the door to the left of the stage, and the stripper will join
you shortly. Talk to her. Follow her outside and stand next to the car. She
will walk off with the gang member that was guarding the car. When his back is
fully turned, right click on the car and place the GPS Transmitter. Make your
way back to the boarding platform.
When you get back to the platform, turn right. Now switch the switch closest
to you. This ensures that every possible area is open to your access. Turn left
and head up the tracks the direction you came at the very beginning of this
mission. You want to go back to the first guy you killed. About now there will
be another gang member discovering the body, so go kill him. Drop your Uzi, and
take his.
Go back to the platform and kill the three gang members with your Uzi. Line up
the two farthest from the platform so you can kill them in one burst of fire,
then quickly turn and ice the third guy. Head between the building towards the
strip club, then turn right and go between the buildings and away from the
strip club. You will find three more gang members standing around a burning
barrel. Kill the two gang members you can see when against the building to the
right, and then the third when he investigates.
Go out of the gate in front of you and find the train tracks. Turn left and
follow the tracks. There is one more gang member patrolling these tracks. He
will spot you first, but isn't a good shot (and who is with an Uzi?), so take
him down.
Check your map. The GPS Transmitter will place a blinking red icon on your
map. You can also take out the GPS Receiver and track the car that way. Either
way, find the gang car. Make sure the Uzi is the only visible object you have
in your hands when you find the gang car, however, as the warehouse is
surrounded by dogs.
Using your Silenced MP5, kill all the dogs surrounding the warehouse. Remove
the GPS Transmitter from the gang car, and then go to the opposite end of the
warehouse. Open the doors of the warehouse and prepare for a firefight. Kill
all gang members you can see, but do not go inside the warehouse. Once the gang
members have stopped filing out towards you, take out your Uzi. Again, open the
door to the warehouse and fire inside to make sure everyone heard you and there
will be no surprises. Once you are sure everyone is dead (on Hard, I count four
gang members), go inside.
Depending on where you entered, there might be two more gang members (in
addition to the four) guarding the briefcase with money. If so, kill them as
well (they will be out in the open). Once everyone in the warehouse is dead, a
message will come up saying Ivan will arrive in three minutes. Use the
strafe-drag trick described at the top of this walkthrough to drag all gang
members out of Ivan's sight. The best place is in the center of the warehouse,
between the boxes found there. Make sure you pick up all the weapons, as well.
You should finish about the time you get the message saying Ivan will arrive
in one minute. Go to the briefcase which should still by lying on the floor,
and pick it up. Select the GPS Transmitter in your inventory and you should
place it in the briefcase. Stand exactly where you picked up the briefcase.
Ivan will arrive shortly. If he sees any gang member's bodies, he will flip
out and you will fail the mission. Apparently, though, he has no problems with
massive amounts of blood stains and the dead dogs outside. Whatever, I won't
argue. He arrives, you give him the money, and he leaves. Good job!

##Not Genocidal##
I need to perfect the order in which I should do things. It's going to be
difficult to plan killing every crew member on the ship. For now, below is the
regular walkthrough.

Background:
Thanks to your job on the previous mission, you now know where Boris is
hiding. Eliminate him and take the ship to international waters. He also
happens to have acquired an old nuclear bomb, which you must prevent from going
off.

Objectives:
-Eliminate Boris
-Nuclear bomb must be disarmed
-Take ship to international waters

Equipment:
Fibre Wire - $110
Beretta 92 Silenced - $775
Kevlar Body Armor - $900

This level is insanely difficult simply because you don't stand a chance
against the guards.

Turn around and climb the ladder you find. Go forward to the train tracks and
continue forward until you are past the closest corner of the closest building
(can be seen to your right). If you don't go far enough, the guard you're about
to sneak up on will see you. Turn right and run towards the building. Hit Sneak
Mode and strangle the guard there. Take his clothes and his MP5. Make sure to
holster everything, but leave the MP5 visible.
Continue in the direction you were facing and turn left to go around the
building. Run forward and right until you come to the train tracks again. Turn
right and follow the tracks until you see two guards standing in front of a
door in the fence. Stop there. You will see two guards come through the door
and walk off to your right. Both guards will return, also from the right. Get
as close as you possibly can to the guard, I recommend using the walk button
and simply staying behind him. Walk up to the door with him and he will say
something to the guards. The door will open. Follow him in, again staying as
close as possible.
Once through the doors, follow the train tracks. They will curve off to the
right, so follow. After the curve, there will be another track joining the
track you are following. The joining track comes from the left. Follow the new
track left. This track eventually turns to the right, so follow. At this point,
take out your Silenced Beretta. Continue down the track while watching the
fence to your right. You will hear a dog bark, and the dog will come at you
from the left. You should have plenty of time to kill it before it gets to you.
Around this area is an opening in the fence to your right. It is marked with
yellow crates on either side. Go inside the fence using this opening.
Turn left and you should see two buildings. Go between them and then continue
in that direction. You will come up on some more tracks, but keep going. To the
left you will see a narrow section between some buildings and the inside fence.
Continue through there, keeping close to the inner fence. When you reach the
end of the fence, you will again see a door in the fence to your left. To the
right of the door, is an opening just like the one you used previously. Go out
of the opening (nobody cares when you do this) and turn right. Move forward,
keeping close to the fence. When the fence turns right, turn right yourself.
You will see two buildings to your left. Again, go between them.
Continue to the edge of the water. Turn left at the edge, and continue around
the edge keeping close to the water. When two more buildings appear to your
left, take out your silenced Beretta. In the alley between the buildings are
two dogs which will attack you. Continue down the edge of the water until you
hear the dogs bark, then shoot them before they get you. Bring back out the MP5
and continue in the direction you were going, but this time stay close to the
second building. Turn left and go around the building until you find two trash
cans. Depending on your timing, there may be a guard between the trash cans and
the building. If there isn't, wait until he arrives. Strangle him, then bring
back out your Silenced Beretta. Go back to the edge of the water and continue
down the pier.
Soon you will come to a group of trailers on your left. There is a dog that
will attack you from between the trailers when you approach. Kill the dog, and
enter the trailer closest to you (the only one you can). In here you will find
a stash of weapons. Go to the back and look left. Pick up the Sniper Ammo,
Beretta, Silenced Beretta, and Hardballer. Turn left and look at the crate on
the ground. Pick up the MP5SD (Silenced MP5) and the Car Bomb. Turn around and
pick up the Sniper's Rifle. If any of Boris' guards see you with this rifle,
they will immediately open fire and/or run and tell Boris. Be very careful.
Exit the trailer and turn right. Follow the edge of the water as you did
before. On your left, close to the water, will be iron pegs (in pairs) which
are used to tie up ships. You will want to stop around the last pair of pegs,
right before the orange crates. From here, you should be able to see two
buildings you passed between earlier (not the two with the dogs-those should be
behind/beside you). Drop the Sniper's Rifle and take out your MP5. Head back
between the two buildings and then left along the fence. Keep going forward
past the corner of the fence to find a guard facing you. Strangle him so he
doesn't see the murders that are about to take place.
Go back to the sniper's rifle and pick it up. Look over the water so you can
see the two guards at the nearest door in the fence, then shoot 'em. They take
two shots in the chest, one in the head. Wait for a minute and watch to make
sure no guards saw them die. If a guard runs up to the bodies, shoot him, too.
Continue around the edge of the water making your way towards the guards you
just shot. On the building closest to the two dead guards is another guard. He
is on the corner closest to the guards, but he shouldn't be alarmed and
shouldn't see you. Use the rifle to look around and again make sure no guards
are close. Pop him in the head.
Continue to follow the edge of the water and press yourself up against the
fence. Using the Sniper's Rifle, again make sure nobody is close, and then take
out the two guards guarding the next door in the fence. The train tracks that
go through the door next to you also go through the door they are guarding.
There is a guard on the rooftop of a building which is on the inside of both
fences. He is standing on the corner closest to the two guards you just shot.
Shoot him, as well.
Turn right and take a M16A2 from one of the dead guards. This will make you
drop your Sniper's Rifle, which you want to do anyway. Open the door and go
forward to the next door. Open it as well. Walk forward and then turn left to
make it on to Boris' pier. Go down the pier towards the two buildings. There
are two guards circling each building. When you approach the first building,
stay on that side of the building. Make sure you're in Sneak Mode and strangle
the guard when he comes near; then leave him. Go around the building (towards
the limo) and follow the other guard so he doesn't suspect you of the killing.
When he finds the dead guard, he will run up to look. Run behind him and
strangle him.
Now go to the second building. Go to the side farthest from the first
building. Strangle one guard as he's walking and then use the same
get-behind-and-strangle-as-he's-looking-at-the-dead-body trick. Now you can
safely take out the limo guard.
Go back to the first building and go to the side with the two dead guards.
Lean around the side so you can see the driver. Whip out your MP5SD and make
short work of him. Like all of Boris' guards, he's wearing a bullet-proof vest,
which means he can take about 6 or 7 shots before going down. Pick up your
M16A2 and bring out the Car Bomb. Go up to the driver's door of the limo and
right click on it, placing the bomb. This car bomb is cooler than the last few
because it goes off then the car is started, so that's it for Boris. Let's hit
the ship.
From between the two buildings, walk up to the ship. Turn left to see the
concrete stairs leading up to the ship. For some strange reason, there is a
lone crew member on the other side of the steps. Go around the steps and
strangle him. Drag his body backwards, between the steps and the ship. Take his
clothes and Beretta and empty your hands. Go back around to the stairs and go
up. The crew shouldn't give you any trouble, now that you look like a crew
member. At the top of the stairs, turn right. Continue and turn left into the
first door you can take. Through here, turn right to find a set of stairs
leading down. Take those stairs down. At the bottom, there will be another set
of stairs off to your right a bit. Take those down as well. Take a sharp right
at the bottom and head down the hallway. Climb the short set of stairs and open
the door.
You will now be in the cargo hold. Turn right and walk past the stairs to the
wall on the other end of the ship. Turn around and you should see some steps
going down. Take those steps down. There will be an opening to your right which
leads to the engine room. There is a guy on the floor of the room in front of
you and one you can't see to the left of the door. Ivan is in the back. Lean in
and cap the guy to the left of the door with your Silenced Beretta (you may
have to actually enter through the opening to do this, but as long as you're
not armed, the crew doesn't care). This will cause the other guy to come at
you. Shoot him, as well. Ivan will then radio to Boris that you are in the
engine room and will try to escape. Shoot him. Boris will arm the nuke and run
like hell. Let him go, the car bomb will take care of him for you.
Once the nuke is armed, everyone makes a mad dash off the ship with the
exception of the captain and the engine room guys. This makes things much
easier. At the back of the engine room is another set of stairs. Again, to the
left and out of your view, is an engine room guy. Lean in and take him out. The
nuclear bomb is to your right. Somehow, Hitman knows how to disarm the bomb
(just like he can drive a boat, fly a plane, etc.), so just right click and
select "Disarm Nuke". That was easy.
Go back up to the cargo hold. Return the way you came and go back up the two
flights of stairs. Once up the second set, take a hard left and you will find
ANOTHER set of stairs. Take those up to the next level. In front of you and to
the left a bit, you will notice a door with a short set of stairs. Open the
door and turn right. You will be facing a ladder. Climb the ladder. At the top
of the ladder, you will see a door. This is the door to the bridge.
Open the door to find the captain. Shoot him however you want, he's the only
one left. In front of where he was standing is the wheel of the ship. Right
click and select "Start Engine". There will be a cut scene telling you to clean
out the ship. Run back down to the engine room where there will be ONE engine
room guy. He will be standing to the left of the opening, exactly where the
other guy was. Lean in and shoot him. Go back up to where the captain was.
Right click on the wheel, start the engine, and this time watch the cut scene
as Hitman drives the ship away.

##Not Genocidal##
This will probably be the hardest level to plan. I haven't even taken a stab
at it, yet. I would also like to point out that unless you cheat, you can never
kill the attendant at the beginning (the door locks behind you and you cannot
take any weapons with you). However, below is the regular walkthrough.

Background:
You have been hired to perform one final hit. You are to eliminate Dr. Kovacs
of a mental asylum. Sound familiar? You fought so long and hard, only to end up
where you began...

Mission Objectives:
-Eliminate Doctor Kovacs

Equipment:
Kevlar Body Armor - $900

Similar to the previous missions, this mission is easy as long as you don't
screw up. Don't bother the SWAT guys, and they won't bother you.

After the introductory cut scene, go forward to the entrance of the asylum. Go
in the double-doors and the receptionist will greet you. You will respond and
the receptionist will open the gate for you. Go into the asylum and up the
stairs (that receptionist gives the WORST directions...). Once on the second
floor, go through the big, metal double-doors you find there. You will find
yourself in the operating theater, at the other end of which there is another
set of big, metal double-doors. Go through those doors.
When you get to the operating theater, you will see a cut scene of Professor
Ort-Meyer calling the cops. Back to the game, once through the second set of
double-doors you will see yet another set of double-doors in front of you and a
bit to the left. Go through those doors. Inside this room, turn left to see the
box on the wall with the red "+" on it. Open the door of the box and remove the
syringe inside. Holster it and exit the room using the double-doors.
Once again facing the big, metal double-doors to the operating theater, you
will also see a single door to the left of the metal doors. Open that door and
go inside. This is Dr. Kovacs' office. You can stay and chat with him, but I
prefer simply to run up behind him before we get into conversation and kill him
with the syringe. Take his clothes (he won't be found) and the key on the wall
opposite the door you came in. Sometime in Dr. Kovacs' office, you will see a
cut scene of the SWAT team rushing in. Good times.
Go back through the operating theater and through the double-doors to the
lobby stairs. Go up the stairs and turn right. Go up THOSE stairs to the third
floor. Turn right and go through the opening you find. Follow the bend left and
through the opening you come to. Turn right here and then turn right again at
the end of the hallway. Open the door you find. Again, follow the bend to the
left and open the door you find. This time move forward and open the door you
come to. Immediately to your right is another door. Open this door to find
yourself in an abandoned room/cell. Open the dresser doors to find an Uzi and
some shotgun ammo. Take the Uzi (what are you going to do with the ammo?) and
then return to the first floor of the lobby (area with the stairs where you
first came in).
Standing of the first floor of the lobby, face the direction of the operating
theater. To your left you will notice a single door underneath the stairs to
the second floor. Open this door and go inside. To your right is another door,
open it. Turn left in this hallway and move forward to the gate. Open the gate
and continue forward to the end of the hall. At the end, there will be some
stairs to your left. Take the stairs up one level. At the hallway at the top of
the stairs, turn left (away from the other stairs). Walk forward and there will
be a set of metal double-doors on your right. Enter this room (the TV room) and
talk to the guy with his head down, sitting on the chair. This is the same CIA
guy you rescued from Lee Hong's basement.
He will ask you to find the Antidote for him. The cage behind him holds the
Antidote, and you took the key from Dr. Kovacs' wall (didn't you?). Go inside
the cage and retrieve the Antidote, which is on the desk on the wall farthest
from the CIA guy (under the light of a desk lamp). Right click on the CIA guy,
and administer the Antidote.
The CIA guy will stand up. Follow him. You have to open doors for him along
the way, which may be a bit annoying, but he will eventually lead you to the
elevator. Talk to him, and he will take the elevator up to the next floor. Take
the steps (revealed by the elevator) down to go to the last mission. Hey, that
cut scene looks familiar!

	**NOTE**
-You can talk to the mental patients. They will ask you to find something for
them, and in return they will give you information. Since all the information
you need to complete the level is in this walkthrough, don't waste your time.
-This is an extremely well-equipped asylum. There are weapons littered
throughout the level (mostly the third floor and the roof). Most of them,
however, cannot be concealed, making them as useless as a hooker at a... well,
you get the idea.

Background:
	(none)

Objectives:
-Eliminate Professor Ort-Meyer

Equipment:
None available

Exactly the same as the regular walkthrough, you DO kill everyone in this
level.

Open the gate and take out your Uzi. Turn left and introduce the guard at the
desk to the meaning of "swift justice." At the side of the desk is a locker.
Open it, and take the shotgun and ammo. Open the gate behind the guard you
killed, and turn left. Go to that gate and open it as well. Turn right and
shoot the guard there in the back. Open the locker next to the desk and take
out the MP5 and the SMG ammo.
Go back to the last gate you opened. Stand behind the wall next to the opening
and use the Lean Right button to look down the hall. The clones will come down
this hall towards you. Shoot them, run up to them, take their gun, and then
duck back to this hiding place. There are ten clones total. Beware, if you take
too long to kill a clone, another clone will be released. If this happens, I
recommend NOT going out to take the fallen clone's gun. Also, in this hiding
place the clones can get stuck right next to you. If you hear two door open and
close and they sound close to you, then strafe out of the hiding place. The
close will come out of the room to your left. For some reason, the clone
doesn't see you when this happens, so pop him and get back to the hiding place.
Be wary, the last clone has some pretty fancy moves, so be prepared for some
Matrix-style bullet dodging. Also, the second, fifth, and tenth clones carry
Silenced MP5s.
Once all ten clones are dead, drag one of them. Go straight down the hall and
through the gate you were facing while hiding. Take a right and open the gate
you find. Turn left in this hallway, and again, open the gate you come to.
Follow this hallway and turn left when it does. Still dragging the clone, step
onto the footsteps in the center of the room you find. If you find closed doors
instead of a room at the end of the hallway, you must simply make your way to
the other doors which should be open. The clones go out of the door that is
farthest from you so you can't just wait for them and pop them as the come out.
Go back and turn back right at the hall. At the end of this hall will be
another gate. Go through that gate and follow the hallway around until you find
the room with the footsteps. Either way, find your way to the footsteps WITH A
CLONE.
Once you step onto the footsteps with a clone, there will be a cut scene and
the door in front of you will open. Ready a weapon, and follow the hallway. You
will be greeted by Professor Ort-Meyer. While he is talking, he will discover
that you are 47 and not 48 (the clones are the next edition of you). Shoot him
before he gets you to finish the game. Congratulations.
