FM Towns is one of those computers that came out only in Japan but it's been
known to have released arcade perfect ports for its system. The first game I
will do for this system will be Super Street Fighter II which introduced 4
new fighters to the previous 12 fighters in the cast. They are Cammy, Fei Long,
Dee Jay, and T(hunder) Hawk. The old fighters got a few new moves up there
arsenal and some new animations for some of their normal attacks.

Each character has a set of special moves in addition to the normal attacks
given to them. They are executed by moving the joystick in a certain sequence
and pressing the appropiate attack button. Sometimes, a character can perform
an extra move by doing a normal attack at close range.
