It seems like Vinny's taking one last trip to the gridiron before hanging up
his cleats for the season. This might be the easiest guide I've ever written,
since John Madden Football '93 Championship Edition is the same as the regular
version of Madden '93, only that some of the teams are different.

While John Madden Football '93 Championship Edition doesn't have today's
graphics or updated rosters, it has a pretty deep playbook for its time and
great music. Many features of later Madden games aren't included, like season
play, and there are no substitutions except for quarterbacks. The 40 teams in
Madden '93 are some of the greatest football teams of all time, although they
don't have player names. Almost every team to make a Super Bowl is included,
although they omit certain teams that are very similar to each other, like
those that appear in back-to-back Super Bowls. The game leaves out the actual
1992 teams. It may take a few minutes to learn all the spins and other moves,
but it's a lot easier than the play control in the ultra-complicated newer
games.

A few notes: Since you're playing an old football video game, I'm assuming you
have some grasp of football theory, rules, and terminology; you know what a
tight end or shotgun formation is. That said, I'm still going to explain
certain terms for the less football-savvy. Remember that results may vary
depending on defense, down, hashmarks, and other factors - especially the
individual abilities of your offensive players. I've tried to test each play
against a variety of defenses, but there's still a chance I may have misjudged
a few plays. Also, no play will work 100% of the time. The five-receiver
formation wasn't around in the NFL in 1992, so don't go looking for any 5-WR
sets or 7-DB "quarter" defenses here, or zone blitzes, for that matter. For
those of you who are counting, there are 59 plays on offense and 64 plays in
the defensive playbook. While some of these plays (or plays that are very
similar) appear in the playbooks of today's Madden games, I don't recommend
trying to use this guide with any games other than the Genesis version of John
Madden Football '93.

Far (8 plays)
===============================================================================
This formation is best for running, although it contains several passing plays.
The only difference between the "Far" and "Near" formations is whether or not
your halfback is on the same side of the formation as the tight end.

---Cross Right---
The split end (B) runs a very effective deep in. The tight end (C) is on an out
pattern, and the halfback (A) will be available in the flat.

---HB Sweep Right---
On this play, the halfback takes the pitch and must run almost to the sideline
before turning. There's obviously a risk here, since a blitzing LOLB will often
stop you for a loss. However, a fast back can easily gain 5-10 yards, and
sometimes far more than that.

---Quick Slant---
The flanker (C) goes in motion at the beginning of the play and runs a post
pattern. Your primary target is the tight end (B), who runs a quick slant that
may face too much traffic to be effective. The halfback (A) may be the safest
pick.

---FB Lead Left---
The halfback lead blocks for the fullback, who runs between the left tackle and
left guard. This is a good way to use a fullback who can break tackles. Don't
be too fast in plowing through the line; wait for the blocking to set up before
making your move.

---HB Screen---
Your primary option for this screen pass is, of course, the halfback (A). A
fast halfback can easily get a first down or a touchdown if you throw a quick,
hard pass. You can also try the split end (B) on the corner or the tight end
(C) on the out.

---FB Counter---
Unless you have a very fast fullback who breaks tackles well, your back will be
stuffed for a big loss, since you take the pitch quite far behind the line of
scrimmage. Not a good play.

---HB Option---
A nervy, exciting play. The quarterback pitches out to the halfback as if this
were a sweep right. However, you can press B to bring up the receiver windows
and throw a pass! The best option is the split end (B) on the post. The flanker
(C) also runs a post. If all else fails, press A to throw to the quarterback.
Of course, you might prefer to take off running, especially if the linebackers
are in coverage. Against a human, be sure to press B to bring up the receiver
windows even if you choose to run; it's a great way to confuse your opponent!

---FB Trap Left---
Not the best running play in the book, even among fullback runs. If you run the
play the way it's drawn, you probably won't gain more than a couple of yards,
so you might prefer to run off right guard.

Near (8 plays)
===============================================================================
---HB Trap Left---
This trap play is pretty reliable at earning four yards, although you'll be
stopped for a loss of one if the IRLB is blitzing.

---Cross In---
On this play action pass, your main target is the flanker (B) on the streak.
The tight end (C) runs a very short out that's good if you want to get the ball
off quickly, while the halfback (A) faces too much traffic against a standard
3-4 or 4-3. It takes a little while for this play to get going, so try
something else if you're expecting a heavy blitz.

---FB Off Tackle---
Not a bad play, but hardly remarkable or memorable. It's difficult for your
fullback to build much momentum with this play. Running between the right guard
and right tackle is generally most effective.

---Play Action---
This is more of a flood right than a play action. The halfback (B) is a good,
safe option in the flat. The flanker (A) on the deep post can earn big yardage,
while the tight end (C) will need to be quick to gain anything more than five
yards.

---FB Lead Right---
Similar to FB Off Tackle, but a little better. The fullback normally runs off
tackle, with the halfback as the lead blocker. If you have a fast fullback and
the strong-side linebacker isn't blitzing, try running to the sideline as if
this were a sweep; you might just earn 50 yards. Otherwise, run the play as you
normally would. In Madden '94, this play is called HB Lead.

---HB Counter---
In a counter play, the running back steps in one direction to fake out the
defense, and then he runs in the opposite direction. This is more like a plain
old sweep right, and it will gain 10 yards even on a bad day. With a couple of
well-timed stiff-arms, you'll score six points (seven if you make the PAT,
obviously).

---HB Screen---
Your primary option for this screen pass is, of course, the halfback (C). A
fast halfback can get good yardage, especially versus a blitz, but against a
short zone, you'll have little luck. You can also throw deep to the streaking
receivers (A and B), but they play so close together the defensive backs may
have an easy time covering them.

---HB Toss Right---
This play isn't quite as great as it is in Madden '96, but it's still very
effective. While this play is not guaranteed to gain yardage, it can usually
produce a gain of ten, and frequently 50.

Pro Form (13)
===============================================================================
The Pro Form formation, also known as Split Backs or other names, is very 
similar to Far/Near. It's good for both running and passing, and it's probably
the formation I use most frequently. As the most popular formation of its time,
the Pro Form has the largest play selection of any set in the game.

---FB Slant In---
The split end (A) on the corner route is lethal if he's in single coverage.
Less effective is the fullback (B), who lines up in the flat and runs a post
pattern. The flanker (C) is an interception risk in man coverage, but he can
also reach the end zone.

---FB Center Trap---
This is another fullback run, which will be pretty effective if your fullback
runs well. Be patient and let the blockers block.

---Swing Curl Left---
All three of your passing options are quite short-range, so Swing Curl Left
will be effective against deep zones. The fullback (A) in the flat is the
safest pick. The halfback (B) on the wheel route can earn excellence yardage if
he's not in too much traffic. The flanker (C), who takes the pass behind the
line of scrimmage (technically a running play), is useless except against deep
zones.

---FB Draw Left---
This is a relatively rare draw play to the fullback. It looks like the
quarterback's throwing, but he's not. This works well if the defense is playing
for the pass, but unless your fullback is fast, you'll lose big yardage against
a blitz.

---P Action Pass---
This is another good play to use when you want to go deep on first down. The
split end (A) and tight end (B) are on deep posts, and the flanker (C) zips
downfield. This play isn't likely to succeed against a medium zone.

---End Around---
In an end around, the quarterback hands off to a wide receiver who's coming
around the bend. Not surprisingly, this play is very risky but can net a big
gain. You need a fast flanker to pull this off, as well as a strong line and a
slow defense. This end around fails against aggressive rush. End arounds are
also beneficial for keeping human players on their toes.

---HB Toss & Pass---
As with HB Option from the Far formation, the halfback takes the pitch and has
the choice of running a standard outside run or throwing a pass. If you choose
to pass, look for your receivers (B and C) on posts before dumping the ball to
the quarterback (A).

---Cross Pass---
The B receiver runs a post pattern that can be dangerous if the safety picks
him up. The flanker (C) goes deep, while the halfback (A) in the flat is a safe
and remarkably effective option.

---HB Toss Left---
This is a good running play for more experienced players. If you can beat the
right cornerback (probably with a stiff-arm), you should reach the sideline and
score.

---Down & Out---
The halfback (A) is a very good option against blitzes and deep zones. The
tight end (B) on the post also works well against blitzes, while the flanker
(C) on the post is more of a deep threat. Overall, a nice play.

---HB Off Tackle---
The halfback runs between the right tackle and tight end or flanker. What more
can you say? This is a good general-purpose run that should consistently gain
about five yards - sometimes more - without much risk. Keep your distance from
the LOLB.

---Rollout Pass---
As with other rollouts, you want the quarterback to leave the pocket before you
take control of him. The split end (B) on the short is perfect against blitzing
inside linebackers. The flanker (A), who goes in motion before the snap, may
face too much traffic to be useful, while the fullback (C) is a good receiver
of last resort. Good against the inside blitz, but a blitzing LOLB will be
trouble.

---Stop Clock---
In this play, the quarterback spikes the ball to stop the clock. It's best used
in two-minute drill situations when stopping the clock is worth losing a down.
In this game, though, it's usually quickest just to run a play. This play
appears in several formations (in the Super NES version of Madden '93, every
formation).

Shotgun (9)
===============================================================================
The Shotgun formation is good for passing because of its "shotgun" snap - the 
quarterback gets the ball several yards behind the line of scrimmage instead of
from right under center. It isn't great for running, though. The John Madden
Football '93 version of the shotgun formation has three receivers, one tight
end, and one running back. This is one receiver less than Run & Shoot. A good
pass-blocking line helps.

---Flood Right---
If he's open, go for the flanker (B) on the deep post. Throwing to the tight
end (A) will succeed against deep zones. Your last option is the back (C), who
will take a while to get open.

---Cross Up---
The B and A receivers cross on post patterns, while the flanker (C) runs an
out-and-up. This play is most effective if you have plenty of time.

---Play Action---
A play action pass seems a little weird in this formation, but this play is 
reasonably good nonetheless. If the B or C receivers aren't open, just dump the
ball off to the halfback (A) in the flat.

---HB Toss Left---
Outside running isn't easy in the Shotgun formation, but good blocking will 
reward you with a big gain. Call an audible in the unlikely event your opponent
has eight men in the box.

---Flood Left---
This is almost like a mirrored Flood Right. The B receiver on the post can net
serious yardage, as can the C receiver on the deep out. The halfback (A) is
again the receiver of last resort. 

---Hail Mary---
All your receivers head deep. This is best used in desperate situations where
a quick touchdown is needed, although you could try it when you really want to
shock the opponents. You'll usually want to take control of the receiver while
the ball is in the air. Use your "Fast" team.

---Post Out---
The split end (A) runs a deep post that has the potential to earn big yardage.
The tight end (B) on the in and the flanker (C) on the out are medium-length
targets.

---Fullback Draw---
This can earn a surprising amount of yardage if the defense is expecting a
pass. Either hit the hole between the pulling right guard and the center, or
run off left tackle.

---Stop Clock---
Use this play to stop the clock in a two-minute drill.

Run-Shoot (9)
===============================================================================
The Run-Shoot formation is named after the Run 'n' Shoot offensive system, as 
this was the formation that system employed much of the time. It's similar to
Shotgun, except that it has four wide receivers and one running back instead of
three receivers, a tight end, and a back. Effective use of the Run & Shoot
formation demands a deep crop of effective wide receivers and an offensive line
that pass blocks well. Because the field is "spread out," you may find it
easier for the quarterback to scramble, especially up the middle. Don't forget
to take advantage of the slot receivers, who often remain uncovered or covered
by a linebacker or safety (especially against a standard 4-3 or 3-4).

---Up Hook---
The split end (A) on the out-and-up is a great deep threat, and the B receiver
on the quick slant is useful against deep zones and mass blitzes. The C
receiver fakes a slant and runs a post.

---Post Up---
Your best option is the split end (A) on the deep post. If he's double-covered,
look for the shorter tight end (B) or the C receiver on the out-and-up. This
play will shred short zones and slow cornerbacks in man coverage.

---Flag Left---
The flanker (C) runs a flag pattern, while the B and A receivers cross on the
left side of the field. The A-button receiver may be a good option if you need
to get out of bounds.

---Quick Outs---
Try a quick, hard pass to the A receiver on the out. The C receiver runs
something more like a slant. If the middle is clear, throw to the B receiver on
the slant.

---FB Draw---
This draw play will be very successful against a Nickel, but a mass blitz will
surely stop it for a loss.

---Deep Outs---
Your main target is the split end (A) on the deep out, who will probably score
a touchdown if he catches the ball. Also look for your interior receivers (B
and C) on posts. This play is best if you need quick yardage, especially in a
two-minute drill.

---Circle---
The main receiver is the halfback (B) on the circle route, but he'll be well-
covered in a standard 3-4 or 4-3. The A receiver goes deep on a post/corner,
and the C receiver runs a nice quick out that's good for shorter-yardage
situations.

---Post In---
The split end (A) on the post is a mighty tempting option if he's single-
covered. The B receiver runs an in pattern, but passes to him are sometimes
caught by the C receiver. The A receiver runs a slant fake/post that won't be
fruitful except against a deep zone.

---Stop Clock---
I really shouldn't have to tell you this again, but the Stop Clock play spikes
the ball so the clock will stop.

Goal Line (8)
===============================================================================
This formation is full of plays that are useful only in short-yardage
situations, especially near the goal line. There are two backs, two tight ends,
and a receiver.

---Play Action---
The quarterback fakes a handoff on this play. Try throwing hard to the B or C
receiver, but if they're covered, go for the riskier halfback (A) in the flat.

---FB Pull---
A good choice if you only need a yard or two. It's not particularly glamorous,
though. As with HB Lead Left, you may prefer to run around the line for the
score.

---QB Sneak---
The Quarterback Sneak is a low-risk play, but don't expect to gain much more
than a yard or two. But it's very good at getting that one yard! 

---HB Lead Right---
Just like HB Lead Left, although slightly more effective.

---Flood Left---
There aren't many passing plays in the Goal Line formation, but this is one of
them. Everyone heads left. The A receiver on the out is your most effective
option, as he's the least likely to be in considerable traffic. You could also
roll out to the right and run for the score. 

---HB Lead Left---
This is a halfback dive. If you need 1-2 yards, HB Lead Left is a good play to
use.

---HB Cut Right---
The goal of this play is to avoid the congestion in the middle by running off
right tackle, although sometimes it's also possible to plunge through the
middle. While nothing is guaranteed inside the five, this play works very
effectively, especially when you need two or three yards.

---FB Cut Left---
Another fullback dive, but this is a bit riskier than FB Pull.

Punt (2)
===============================================================================
These plays will appear only if you select the "Special Teams Punt" player set.

---Punt---
When it's fourth down and too far to kick, you will usually want to punt. And 
this is the play to select when you wish to do so.

---Fake Punt---
As you know, fake punts are risky. This is the pass form of the fake punt. Look
for your Y, B, and A receivers and throw to whoever's open. Your B man is
safest, while Y and A are best for longer gains. This play can be quite
effective against human players, if just for the shock value alone.

Field Goal (2)
===============================================================================
Use the "Special Teams Field Goal" players to access these plays.

---Field Goal---
This play lets you kick a field goal. What a surprise! Don't try to kick a
field goal unless you're inside the opposition 30 or so, though. In newer
Madden games, this is the play to select when you want to kick an extra point
after a touchdown, although the two-point conversion wasn't around in the NFL
in 1992.

---Fake FG---
Fake field goals are very risky, so use them carefully. Your best bet is the B
option on this standard pass-based fake field goal. Ignore the kicking meter.
As with fake punts, fake field goals are most dangerous against human
opponents.

Defensive Playbook                                                   [DEFPB]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm not going to be as verbose on the defensive plays. Instead, I'm just going 
to give a few details about each play; you can tell a lot just from the names 
and diagrams.

4-3 (18)
===============================================================================
The 4-3 system has four defensive linemen, three linebackers, two cornerbacks,
and two safeties. It's the primary defensive set of about half of the teams in
the NFL in 1992.

(Cover)
---Mad Tiger Blitz---
All three linebackers are blitzing. The offensive line won't be able to hold
back the seven-man rush for long. However, the receivers will be in single
coverage, since only four men are in coverage.

---Short Zone 2---
Needless to say, this is a short zone defense. It's designed to contain the
short pass without being too weak against the rushing game and deep threats.

---Man/Zone 1---
Eight men are in the box, so it won't be easy to run against this defense. The
long ball could be a problem, though, since only one safety is covering the
pass.

---Medium Zone---
This is a medium zone defense, which contains the pass effectively but may have
difficulty against the ground game, especially runs off guard.

---Wide Zone 3---
Four men are playing deep to protect against the long ball, but watch out for
runs and passes up the middle.

---Triple Zone---
Triple Zone will usually put the opposition flanker in triple coverage, but the
split end will have just one man to beat. The linebackers are playing man-to-
man to stop the run.

(Read)
---Jet Blitz---
The LLB is blitzing, and the DLE and DLT are on a stunt. One safety is playing
to stop the run, while the other is in "center field" providing backup to the
cornerbacks.

---Tuf Bronco---
Basically a mirrored former of Jet Blitz, except the safety is playing more on
the flanker's side of the field.

---Short Zone 1---
This short zone is very similar to Short Zone 2.

---Man Left---
A man-to-man defense, with more protection on the left side of the field than
the right.

---Man Right---
The mirrored form of Man Left. Surprise!

---Wide Zone 1---
Seven men are in coverage, so passing won't be easy. The quarterback won't be
under much pressure, though.

(Attack)
---Monster Blitz---
The middle linebacker blitzes, crushing the inside running game and putting
enormous pressure on the quarterback. A pass up the middle could be dangerous,
though.

---Jam Middle---
Both outside linebackers blitz, while the linemen rush toward the middle of the
line. This play is good at stopping the inside run but is weaker against
sweeps and passes to the flats.

---Cheat Left---
All of your linemen rush toward the left side of the defensive line. The idea
is to block the left tackle and allow the blitzing RLB to come around to sack
the quarterback or stop left outside rushes. It'll take some time for this to
happen, though, especially if you don't have a fast linebacker. I recommend
that you control the RLB if you want a sack. The receivers and tight end will
be matched up in single coverage.

---Cheat Right---
The same as Cheat Left, only to the right. Consider taking control of the LLB.
Even if you don't get the quarterback, you might be able to tip his pass.

---Man/Zone 2---
The linebackers play to stop the run, while both safeties play deep to back up
the cornerbacks. A good first-down call.

---Wide Zone 2---
This is a fairly standard zone defense.

3-4 (15) 
===============================================================================
The 3-4 is similar to the 4-3 in many aspects, but there are differences. The
3-4 has three linemen and four linebackers, whereas the 4-3 uses four linemen
and three linebackers. The primary advantage of a 3-4 is it allows teams to put
more pressure on the quarterback in unpredictable ways. The disadvantage is it
requires specialized personnel, such as a massive nose tackle. A real team may
have some difficulty regularly switching between a 3-4 and a 4-3, but you can
do it as much as you want in a video game. In real life, precisely half the NFL
defenses used the 3-4 in 1992.

(Cover)
---Safety Blitz---
Yikes! All four linebackers are blitzing, in addition to the safety. Wavers of
the Terrible Towel will like this. Of course, only three players are protecting
against the pass.

---Short Zone---
This is basically an ordinary short zone, although the safeties play fairly
deep. This will be effective against stopping passes to the flats.

---Man/Zone 2---
Another good versatile 3-4 scheme. The defensive linemen rush toward the left
side of the offensive line, and the safeties cover the sidelines. 

---Medium Zone---
Same as the other one.

---Wide Zone 2---
This is a lot like Wide Zone 1. You'll cover the pass, but you aren't likely to
touch the quarterback.

---Triple Zone---
Not too different from the 4-3 version of Triple Zone; both safeties focus on
shutting down passes to the flanker. The DLE and NT are on a stunt.

(Read)
---Man Left---
Man Left is like it is in the 4-3; it's man coverage with more men on the left
side of the field. 

---Man Right---
Basically the reverse of Man Left. Helps contain the tight end and flanker.

---Tight Man---
This is tight man coverage with three linebackers blitzing.

---Wide Zone 3---
Just like Wide Zones 2 and 1.

---Medium Zone---
Medium Zone will shut down a pass of 15-20 yards, but a run may cause trouble.

---Monster Blitz---
Eight men are in the box, and three linebackers are blitzing. Not a good play
to run against.

(Attack)
---Jet Blitz---
This is the equivalent of the 4-3 Jet Blitz. In this man-to-man system, the LLB
blitzes, and one safety stops the run and one plays deep.

---Jam Middle---
This is one of the most run-oriented 3-4 defenses. Three linebackers are
rushing, and both safeties play close to the line.

---Man/Zone 1---
No one blitzes here. With all the linebackers in coverage, it's going to be
tough to find someone open, especially in the short zones.

---Wide Zone 1---
This play is designed to clog up the short zones. Good against two-tight end
sets and passes to the flats.

Nickel (10)
===============================================================================
The Nickel defense is best used in passing situations, as there are five 
defensive backs instead of four.

(Cover)
---Man Tiger---
Both linebackers blitz. Your center defensive back is also blitzing, but he's
too far away from the line of scrimmage to do anything unless you're
controlling him.

---Safety Cheat---
The defensive tackles are on a stunt, while the center safety comes charging
forward. He won't reach the QB unless you take control of him manually, though.
This safety charge could leave a hole in the deep zone in the center of the
field.

---Circle Zone---
This is a zone defense that's shaped in a circle. The weak point is the middle
of that circle, although even passes there aren't going to cause too much
damage.

---Full Zone---
Every zone is covered here, including the flats. However, this play could be
very vulnerable to an inside run, particularly a draw play.

---Bump & Run---
In Bump & Run, the linebackers play outside to stop outside runs. The defensive
backs play man coverage.

---Prevent---
Everyone goes deep, so use this only when your opponents are in a two-minute 
drill and are trying to gain yards quickly. It's best against a "Hail Mary" or 
similar play.

(Read)
---Red Dog---
Woof! Both linebackers are blitzing, so this is a good way to put pressure on
the quarterback without forsaking the deep zones.

---Tight Man---
One linebacker is blitzing, and the defensive backs are in man coverage. The
defensive line is rushing towards the center, so the inside run won't be able
to do much, but an off left tackle could be dangerous.

---Double FL---
This double-teams the flanker. A good way to shut down a particularly dangerous
receiver.

---Double SE---
Identical to Double FL, except this puts the split end (or sometimes the
flanker) in double coverage.

---Bump & Run---
Same as in Cover.

---Prevent---
Another redudancy.

Dime (9)
===============================================================================
The Dime formation is even more pass-oriented, with six defensive backs and
just one linebacker. Since it's weak against most running plays, especially the
inside run, the Dime should generally be reserved for prevent situations.

(Cover)
---CB Blitz---
One of the cornerbacks blitzes the quarterback here, while the rest of the 
secondary is able to fill the hole.

---Center Blitz---
The lone linebacker blitzes, while the secondary plays man coverage.

---Double Blitz---
The second cornerback and linebacker blitz, with the other five defensive backs
providing the other assignments.

---Short Zone---
The cornerbacks and linebacker protect against the short pass, while your 
safeties drop back to provide a last line of defense.

---Prevent 1---
The classic prevent defense. All of your defensive backs head deep to prevent 
the big play. Because of its passive nature, you definitely don't want to use
it except when necessary.

---Prevent 2---
This deep zone stops the outside pass but may be vulnerable against passes in
the flat. Good in a two-minute drill.

(Read)
---Safety Cheat---
One of your safeties will be blitzing, but unless you take manual control of
him, you won't come near the quarterback.

---Double FL---
This play usually double-teams the flanker.

---Double SE---
This play double-teams the receiver lined up on the left side of the offense, 
usually the split end.

---Short Zone---
The last three plays are all redundancies of the Cover set.

---Prevent 1---
The classic prevent defense. All of your defensive backs head deep to prevent 
the big play. Because of its passive nature, you definitely don't want to use
it except when necessary.

---Prevent 2---
This deep zone stops the outside pass but may be vulnerable against passes up
the middle. Good in a two-minute drill.

Goal Line (9)
===============================================================================
The Goal Line formation counters the offensive version of the Goal Line. This 
should only be used near the goal line or possibly in certain obvious short-
yardage situations.

(Read)
---Man Left 2---
This is more aimed at stopping the pass and the outside left run.

---Zone/Man---
This is a man-to-man defense that's good against the pass down the middle.

---Man Right 2---
Basically a mirrored Man Left 2.

(Attack)
---Left---
This is a general-purpose goal line defense that rushes toward the left side of
the line.

---Center---
This is more geared toward stopping the inside run.

---Right---
Very similar to Left.

(Cover)
---Man Left 1---
In this man coverage system, the safety provides extra coverage on the left
side of the field.

---Safety Blitz---
One of the defensive backs will blitz.

---Man Right 1---
Similar to Man Left 1, except the safety covers the right side of the field,
and two pairs of linemen are on stunts.

Special Teams (3)
===============================================================================
These plays are designed to defend against punts and field goals.

---Punt Rush---
Here your team goes all out trying to block the punt, but you won't be able to 
get a good return.

---Punt Return---
Here your personnel will be blocking for your return man in an attempt to get a
good return.

---Field Goal Block---
Use this if you know your opponent will be kicking a field goal.

FAQs and General Tips                                                [NOTES]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Q: What plays are audibles?
A: In John Madden Football '93, you can't set audibles manually, and you can
only audible into a different play in the same formation, not into a different
play in a different formation. Among offensive plays, the A audible is usually
a pass, often a play action. The B button is used for runs, and C for anti-
blitz plays. On defense, the A button is for stopping the run, B is a blitz,
and C audibles are geared toward stopping the pass. For the record, this game
has the same defensive audibles as the Super NES version of Madden '93, but not
the same offensive audibles.

Q: What's the difference between each player set?
A: Before calling an offensive play, you must choose between six different sets
of players. Unless you're kicking a field goal or punting, you'll have four
options to choose from on normal plays. The player positions will not differ
depending on the team you select.

Normal: Your top two wide receivers, a tight end, your starting halfback, and
a fullback: Your normal setup. Use this when you're in the Pro-Form, Far, or
Near formations.

Fast: This set features four wide receivers and your backup running back. This
should be selected exclusively when using the Run 'n' Shoot (and maybe Shotgun)
formation, because the lack of a tight end and fullback will make running
difficult in other formations. Also, you'll have your third receiver replacing
the normal halfback.

Hands: This can work when using the Shotgun formation or when you know you'll
be passing from a two-back system. Your standard starting halfback will be the
fullback, and the backup HB will play halfback. Your third receiver will play
split end and your fourth receiver will be the tight end, while the standard
flanker remains in the game.

Big: This two-tight end set works well in the Goal Line formation, but it might
also be worth a try when you know you'll be running in the Pro-Form, Far, and
Near formations. The tight end replaces the split end, and your fourth receiver
inexplicably becomes the flanker.

Special Teams Field Goal: It's what it says: Field goal plays.

Special Teams Punt: Pick this set when you punt.

Q: How do I use a hurry-up offense?
A: I don't think you can. Tell me if I'm wrong.

Q: How do I kick an onside kick?
A: As in real life, onside kicks are very difficult to execute properly. First
press A to call a kickoff audible, and then press C to change your team's
alignment. Press C to start the power bar, and hold Right on the Control Pad to
angle the kickoff toward the side where all your players are. You want to stop
the power bar when it's on the way down. It takes a lot of practice to do this
right, and even still your odds aren't great.

Q: Where's the Kneel Down play?
A: There isn't one. If you need to run out the clock without risking a fumble,
try something like FB Pull from the Goal Line formation. Another option is to
select a passing play and dive backwards right after you take the snap.

Q: Is there fatigue in this game?
A: No. No matter how fast a player runs, no player ever gets fatigued. Players
could first tire in Madden '97.

Q: What makes artificial turf different?
A: Players have slightly better traction on artificial turf than on real grass
(and in real life, players got really bad injuries on Astroturf). Also, if a
game is played indoors, there won't be any wind, which affects special teams.

Q: In real life, what teams used 4-3 defenses and which used the 3-4?
A: All teams in this game use a 4-3 in most situations except for All-Madden,
All-Madden Greats, Baltimore 70, Oakland 76, Denver 77, Oakland 80,
Philadelphia 80, San Francisco 81, Cincinnati 81, Los Angeles 83, Miami 84, San
Francisco 84, New England 85, New York Giants 86, Denver 87, Cincinnati 88,
Buffalo 90, San Francisco 89, and New York Giants 90.

Q: What teams are in this game?
A: The complete list: All Madden, All Madden Greats, Kansas City 66, Green Bay
66, Oakland 67, New York Jets 68, Baltimore 68, Minnesota 69, Kansas City 69,
Baltimore 70, Dallas 71, Miami 72, Washington 72, Minnesota 73, Pittsburgh 75,
Dallas 75, Oakland 76, Minnesota 76, Dallas 77, Denver 77, Pittsburgh 78, Los
Angeles (Rams) 79, Oakland 80, Philadelphia 80, San Francisco 81, Cincinnati
81, Washington 82, Los Angeles Raiders 83, Miami 84, San Francisco 84, Chicago
85, New England 85, New York Giants 86, Washington 87, Denver 87, Cincinnati
88, San Francisco 89, Buffalo 90, New York Giants 90, and Washington 91. The
Redskins and Raiders have the best teams in this game, at four each. Many
franchises aren't represented at all.

Q: What's the best way to put pressure on the opposing quarterback?
A: Select the middle linebacker. Charge past the center and squash the 
quarterback! Even better, start running toward the line of scrimmage before the 
snap to get a running start. There's another way, too...

Q: Where is the line of scrimmage?
A: According to this game's nearsighted referee, it's at the feet of the
offensive linemen, not the ball. With a little practice, you can line up a
safety or other fast player in the "neutral zone" and squash the quarterback,
deflect the pass, or stop the runner for a loss. This works especially well
from the Punt Rush play when you know the defense will punt.

Q: Why is the computer controlling my quarterback?
A: If you don't press any buttons after the snap, the computer takes over. The
same goes on defense. You can usually generate better results than the
computer, though.

Q: How do I call a timeout?
A: From the pause screen, just press A, assuming you have one or more timeouts
remaining. As you probably know, timeouts stop the game clock, so they're
useful in a two-minute drill or when you're about to get a delay of game
penalty.

Q: What penalties appear in this game?
A: Basically, you can get a delay of game penalty if you take too long to call 
your play on offense, and on defense you can get called for offsides by moving 
past the line of scrimmage before the snap. A few other penalties are rare,
like illegal procedure (kicking the ball out of bounds on a kickoff). And in
2-Player Head-to-Head mode, penalties appear randomly but can be challenged.

Q: What should I choose when I win the toss?
A: It doesn't matter, although it's more fun to receive first. If you're 
deciding the goal to defend, you might want to have a tailwind on the kickoff. 
But it doesn't matter at all.

Q: What other tips do you have?
* If you call an audible by mistake, just wait a couple of seconds and you can
snap the ball as normal without calling an audible (wait for "Audible" to
disappear).
* The set, formation, and play assigned to the B button is always "Madden's
Choice." If you're too lazy or indecisive to call your own plays, just keep
pressing B and you'll get a reasonable play for your situation. Also, on
passing plays, the B receiver should generally be your #1 target.
* This is common sense, but if you have a good running back and a weak passing
game (like the 1985 Bears), you'll want to run the ball a lot. Likewise, if you
pass well but can't run (like the 1987 Broncos), you should keep the ball in
the air.
* If you want to win with ease, pick a team that has a great running back,
like Walter Payton for the 1985 Bears.
* Run straight if you want to keep going fast; zig-zags slow you down.
* Blitzes don't just increase the chances of a sack; they also make it easier
to deflect passes.
* Remember you can move your defenders a little past the line of scrimmage
before the snap, making it easier to sack the opposing quarterback.
* If you're playing on an emulator, assign the A, B, and C buttons to the X, C, 
and V keys, respectively, to ease play-calling.

Q: What other notes do you have for the game?
A: Just a few miscellaneous tidbits:
* I don't include team stats because there's no objective way to rate the
teams.
* In earlier Madden games, the "Attack" subsection of defensive playbooks is
known as "Control."
* You might enjoy slamming into opposing players after the whistle blows. You
won't even get called for unnecessary roughness for doing so.
