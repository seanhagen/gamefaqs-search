1) INTRODUCTION
==============================================================================

Welcome to our King of Fighters XII (KOF XII) movelist/guide and thank you for
reading. This guide will attempt to document the various changes that have
taken place since King Of Fighters XI (KOF XI), while providing a basic move 
list and move properties description where appropriate. Please note that this 
is NOT, and will never be a combo guide, and whatever combos mentioned in here 
are as examples to highlight a move's property.

ABOUT KOFXII

KOF XII is the first Taito X2 KOF game and is a complete overhaul of the 
gameplay as we know it. Utilizing brand new sprites in wonderful hi-def, the 
series returns to a standard 3 vs. 3 format, throwing out the old Tactical 
Shift system. There are many, many alterations as a result which include:

- The cast has been trimmed significantly to only 22 characters, two of which 
  are exclusive to home versions of the game.
- All sprites have been completely redrawn, the first such major overhaul of 
  the character sprites since KOF '96. 
- There is no story in this game, which functions as a psuedo-dream match 
  game. Instead Arcade Mode works as a Time Trial, where you must complete 
  five matches against random teams as quickly as possible.
- A new Critical Counter bar is added in, which increases as you give and 
  take damage. When it is full and if your character performs their Critical 
  Counter Initiator, a Counter Combo will start which enables characters to 
  perform a wide array of attacks at once.
- The game no longer tells you if a Counter Hit has been landed and instead 
  has the opponent twirl around upon being hit. You can recognize this also 
  by looking at the bigger white spark. You can now follow up Counter Hits 
  with other attacks.
- Blowback Attacks are performed by pressing CD now, as there is no E button 
  in this game. Blowback Attacks can now be charged up which can either guard 
  break or give an opponent a "crumble" animation, which means the opponent 
  drops to his knees allowing followups. Blowback Attacks can also now be 
  comboed from strong attacks and juggle an opponent.
- Despite the small cast, a lone new entry makes his KOF debut: Raiden from 
  Fatal Fury.
- All characters can only perform DMs rather SDMs and LDMs, charged up by a 
  bar which increases as you give and take damage. To compensate for this, 
  DMs now do increased damage.
- Roll Canceling is now added in, and at no cost to either meter.
- Basic Throws are now performed by b/f + A+C and will now whiff, but also 
  cannot be escaped from.
- Blowback Counters can be performed even if you are not blocking, and each 
  character has different animations for them rather than their respective CD 
  attacks.
- All characters lack far animations for their normal attacks, save for one or 
  two of them, now given with different inputs.
- Significantly dumbed down AI. The AI has taken a back seat in this game, 
  lending to the game's new Arcade Mode Time Trial.
- And of course, many many (B. Jenet gets to me too!) changes the character 
  movesets and properties.

 (air)                      Move can be done on the ground or in mid-air *
 * Some aerial moves can be launched during a backstep or used directly from
   the ground by extending the command so it ends with a jump. For example,
   Robert's HienRyujinKyaku can be done off the ground by motioning qcb,ub+K.
   Keep in mind that you cannot cancel a ground normal attack into an aerial
   special move.

 HIT LOCATION PROPERTIES
 [O] - Overhead/High level attack, must be blocked standing.
 [M] - Mid-level attack, can block standing or crouching.
 [L] - Move hits low and must be blocked crouching.
 [U] - Move is unblockable.
 [-] - Move does not hit, see additional notes.

 COMMAND ATTACK PROPERTIES
 S   - Cancelable into special moves and DMs.
 X   - Move can be canceled into, but it won't combo.

 SPECIAL MOVES PROPERTIES
 A   - Autoguard. All attacks cause chip damage during autoguard.
 KD  - Knockdown, can be recovered using the Fallbreaker. (L)DMs, throws and 
       sweeps (crouching D) generally knock down upon hitting, so only the NR
       property will be used if the move isn't recoverable.
 NR  - No Recovery Knockdown, cannot Fallbreaker from this move.
 OTG - Over the Ground: Move can hit an opponent that has been knocked down.
 J   - Juggles opponent, can followup after move. Juggles always knock down.
       If no followup was done, a juggled character may use the Fallbreaker 
       upon landing.
 T   - Throw move, cannot be reversed. Basic throws will not be noted.
 P   - Projectile, cannot be reversed, though certain moves absorb or reflect
       them.
 RV  - Reversal move. Works against non-throw, non-projectile moves only. 
       Unless otherwise noted.
 DM  - Desperation Move, requires a full stock bar to use.

 #   - See notes.

 CANCEL CHART NOTES
 - I based my cancel charts off the KOFXI Conqeror's Guide, which may or may
   not be accurate. These notations will be used:
   r  = repeatable into itself (LIGHT ATTACKS ONLY).
   c  = cancelable into command/special moves and DMs.
   s  = cancelable into special/DMs.
   -  = not cancelable or repeatable.
 - To read the cancel chart, the first value in brackets [] indicate the
   hit location, the second value for light attacks represent repeatability,
   while the last value represents cancelabilty.
 - CD button attacks will only be noted twice, once for 'standing near' and
   again for 'vertical jump' as there are only two versions, one each for
   ground and air. The guide only specifies if CD attacks are cancelable into
   special moves. 
 - All cancelable ground CD attacks can be empty canceled.

 CRITICAL COUNTER INITIATOR:
 - Each character has one initiator which is either their standing C or 
   standing D attacks. If such moves connect on a Counter Hit with the 
   Critical Counter meter full, a Counter Combo may be started.

 DEADLOCK
 - Deadlock occurs when two hits trade each other. This is denoted by a special
   sound effect and some red graphical effects. The default action that happens
   after a Deadlock is that both characters hop back. However, either character
   choose to instantly cancel into any other action, such running, jumps, or
   making other attacks.
 - Each character gets a fraction of the damage each attack would have done if
   they had landed normally. It is possible to be KOed as a result of damage in
   this manner.
 - Projectiles can be 'deadlocked' by hitting them with a strong attack with the
   right timing. In such a case the person throwing the projectile must still
   recover while the other player can cancel into any action. This requires some
   strict timing, however.

#. Note that Kyo's standing D is his old far D animation, unlike some 
   other characters.
1. GOUFU YOU: It's an overhead kick when used on it's own. It loses 
   this property when combo from any sort of attack. Can no longer be 
   combo into.
2. HATIZYUUHATISIKI: Both hits are low attacks and can be combo from 
   light attacks. Kicks come out quicker for easier combos but the 
   first kick no longer can be combo into.
3. ONIYAKI: Anti air attack, light version hits twice. The hard version 
   hits three times and leaves Kyo higher in the air increasing his 
   recovery. It's possible to miss the full hits of the move depending 
   on range.
4. YAMIBARAI: Ground level projectile. Light version travels slower 
   than the hard. It is possible to have two projectiles on screen.
5. KAI: You no longer have to press kick twice since both kicks come 
   out automatically. Hard version of this move has a juggle property. 
   Light version does not juggle, but can be chained from light attacks.
6. OBOROGURUMA: An old favorite from his '95 days. Light version hits 
   once and can be combo from weak attacks and has a juggle property. 
   Hard version hits three times and can't be fallbroken. Hard version 
   makes Kyo travel further and has more recovery time.
7. KOTOTSUKI YOH: Light version makes Kyo run half the screen, while 
   the hard verison allows him to run the full length of the screen. 
   Can be blocked and is not considered a throw. Kyo has a taunt 
   animation if the move connects which can be canceled.
8. OROTINAGI: No longer has immunity for either version. The flame wave 
   can negate normal/DM projectiles and is not negateable. The flame 
   wave is also much larger than in previous versions. Can be delayed 
   by holding punch but does not increase it's power in this way. Kyo 
   has a taunt animation if the move connects which can be canceled.

   Critical Counter Initiator: close C

#. Loses his Vendemiaire (command throw) and two of his command attacks, but 
   gains a new move Genie.
1. FLOREAL: Ash's command kick. The light version is slower and makes him 
   move forward. The hard version is faster and makes him move back. The
   light version can be combo from hard attacks. The hard version can
   be combo from light attacks. 
2. VENTOSE: Mid level projectile, light version travels very slowly.
   The hard version comes out a little slower but can actually hit at start 
   up similar to his '03 version. The strong version hits up to 3
   times at close range. Both versions combo from light attacks.
3. NIVOSE: Anti-air kick that combos from light attacks. The hard version
   is stronger, goes higher and further and can still combo from light 
   attacks but has longer recovery time. You may not get the full hits of 
   either version depending on the range it was performed at.
4. GENIE: New move for Ash. Works similar to Goenitz's Yonokaze. Depending 
   on the button pressed determines the distance. A version will be very 
   close to Ash while the D version will go about 3/4 width of the screen. 
   They blow up after a brief period of time.
5. SANS-CULOTTE: Ash covers himself in a column of fire. Has changed 
   incredibly since XI, while it does more damage it no longer grants Ash 
   "Zero Charge Time."Can be used to juggle opponents in the corner. Note 
   that the input timing is pretty strict but can be executed easier if 
   combo from normal attacks.
6. THERMIDOR: Multi-hit DM projectile. Comes out slower than it did in XI, 
   Ash can move shortly after throwing the projectile, which cannot be 
   reflected or negated. The DM has a juggle property after connecting and 
   can be followed up. However, Ash can be hit before launching the 
   projectile which aborts the move entirely.
7. PLUVIOSE: Triple Nivose. Executes fast which can be combo from light 
   attacks. May not get full hits from a jumping or juggled opponent unless 
   they were fairly close to Ash when the move executes.

   slightly stronger but has more recovery time. Hard version executes slower, 
   but has less recovery time and has a juggle function and has more range in 
   the air.
3. SHOGETSU: Both versions have lower body immunity. Light version comes out 
   faster and can combo from light attacks.
3. AKEGARASU: Iori dashes in with a slash, like Mature's Metal Massacre. 
   Iori will not slash unless he is within range of the move itself otherwise 
   he'll just dash. Light version covers less ground than the hard version. 
   Executes very fast and depending on range has fairly safe recovery.
4. TSUCHITSUBAKI: New command grab, unblockable and can combo from 
   hard attacks. Has a juggle property.
5. YAOTOME: Iori's new "flameless" Yaotome, very nice finish might I add! 
   Iori can go under mid-level projectiles. He can be hit during start up 
   but is invincible during the dash.

#. Andy's Close B links with his Far D.
1. HIRATEUCHI: Can be combo from light attacks and can be combo into 
   anything else.
2. ZANEIKEN: Note the charge motion. Comes out faster than ever now. If Andy 
   isn't within range he will rush in without an attack. Combos from light 
   attacks.
3. KUUHADAN: Multi hitting anti-air attack. Light version comes in lower and 
   straighter angled, while the hard version comes in higher and at a much 
   steeper angle. It is possible to crossup with the hard version depending 
   on the range that it comes in at.
4. BREAKING: Andy now has an interrupt to his Kuuhadan on the first hit. Andy 
   can follow up with other specials. This also allows a safe way to cancel 
   out of the move if blocked.
5. SHORYUUDAN: Anti-air attack, light version hits once and travels lower to 
   the ground. While the hard version hits three times and travels higher in 
   the air. This increases it's recovery time.
6. HISHOUKEN: Mid level projectile, light version travels slower than the hard
   version. It is possible to have two projectiles on screen at once.
7. CHOUREPPADAN: Improved Kuuhadan with more hits and damage. Travels as high 
   as the hard Kuuhadan but with a longer angle.

#. Kim's far D hits twice, but isn't cancelable on either hit. 
1. NERICHAGI: Overhead kick. Doesn't combo from normal attacks. Can be 
   cancelable when canceled into, but loses it's overhead property.
2. YOPUCHAJI: New command attack, will whiff crouching opponents. Can be 
   canceled from light attacks. When this connects Kim will jump backwards 
   which will allow him to use his aerial normals and specials for followups.
3. HISHOUKYAKU: Reverted back to a qcf motion. When it connects it'll hit the 
   opponent several times and knock him down. This is similar to his '02 form 
   but unlike that version Kim can now do this move from small jumps. On block 
   kim gets pushed back with noticable recovery time. This move also can be 
   peformed using a lax motion at the end of the qcf motion if you press uf 
   and kick he will perform the move inches off the ground.
4. HANGETSUZAN: Light version does one hit while the hard version does three.
   Both versions knock down.
5. KUCHUUHANGETSUZAN: Kim now has an aerial version of his Hangetsuzan. This 
   move hits once and can not be fallbroken from. This move can also be done 
   from a small jump and also has the lax motion by adding a ub motion at the 
   end of the command. This can also be used as a crossup given enough range 
   and timing.
6. HIENZAN: Anti air kick, light version does one hit while the hard version 
   does three. Both versions can combo from light attacks. The hard version 
   no longer has the no recovery kick follow up like in previous versions.
7. HOUOUKYAKU: No longer can be done in the air anymore. This move can now be 
   fallbroken.

   Critical Counter Initiator: close C

1. UPPER: Can be combo from light attacks. Can also be followed up after his 
   Low Kick. Both means can combo into something else.
2. LOW KICK: Despite it's name it actually hits mid-level. Can be combo from 
   hard attacks.
3. USHIROGERI: Cross up kick, looks and works a lot like Iori's old Yuri Ori.
   This is NOT an overhead. Robert can also use this during a backstep which 
   is quicker than his normal back dash.
4. RYUUGEKIKEN: Mid-level projectile, light version travels slower than the 
   hard version, both travel the length of the screen. Because of the speed 
   the light version travels you are not able to have two projectiles on 
   screen.
5. RYUUGA: Anti air attack, can combo from light attacks. Light version is 
   lower to the ground and hits once. The hard version travels higher in the 
   air and hits twice though this increase Robert's recovery time.
6. HIENSHIPPUKEN: Old-school charge motion with a twist. Flying kick that 
   works as a good anti air, executes fairly quickly. Light version hits once
   and has better recovery time. Hard version hits twice but leaves Robert
   with a lot more recovery time. Robert bounces back upon successfully 
   hitting with the hard version.
7. HIENRYUUJINKYAKU: Aerial Flying kick, like all air moves this one can 
   also be used in a lax motion by adding an ub motion and kick after the 
   qcb motion. Has noticably long recovery upon block.
8. RYUUREN GENEIKYAKU: Command throw that can be combo from hard attacks. 
   The taunt animation cannot be canceled from.
9. GENEIKYAKU: Trap move that works great against rolls and bad jump ins. 
   Combos from hard attacks only. Note that the 'taunt' animation at the end 
   of this move is NOT cancelable.
10.RYUUKORANBU: Auto combo DM, combos from hard attacks and command attacks. 
   Robert is invincible during the forward dash but can be hit from the start 
   up flash. 
11.HAOUSHOKOUKEN: Fast DM Projectile, negates normal projectiles. Can be 
   negated by other DM projectiles.

#. Benimaru's jump ceiling is now on par with other characters.
1. JACKKNIFE KICK: Combos from hard attacks, but no longer can be combo into.
2. FLYING DRILL: The drill can actually be combo from a hard punch. Though
   you'll probably have to jump in rather shallow for it to actually connect.
3. RAIJINKEN: Comes out a little slower than XI but still only hits once. 
   It also now has a juggle property to it. This move can still hit opponents
   if Benimaru was hit by an attack beforehand.
4. KUUCHUU RAIJINKEN: No longer knocksdown, Benimaru will continue to fall 
   afterwards. Light version makes him fall forward while the hard version 
   makes him fall backwards. Like all aerial moves it can be performed 
   with the lax motion by adding an uf to the motion.
5. IAIGERI: Comes out quick and can be combo from light attacks.
6. HANDOUSANDANGERI: Followup to the Iaigeri, like XI it can no longer be 
   performed if the Iaigeri misses. But unlike XI it has reverted back to 
   it's old command. The move can actually be done by simply doing an up or 
   up-forward motion after the Iaigeri. The game will pick up the down motion 
   from the qcf of the Iaigeri.
7. BENIMARU LANCER: New move for Beni, can act as a pre emptive anti air or a 
   roll trap. After it connects it has a juggle property for followups. Oddly
   this can combo from a standing D on a Counter Hit but not a standing C.
8. SUPER INAZUMA KICK: His old anti air move returns! Light version does 2 
   hits while the hard version does 3. Can combo from light attacks. Benimaru
   no longer flips backwards for the light version and will land straight down
   after the kick for both versions.
9. BENIMARU ROLLING THUNDER: Can negate projectiles and is great for roll 
   trapping. Depending on where the opponent get hit determines roll recovery. 
   If the opponent is hit on the ground he's collapes to his knees. This can 
   NOT be followed up however. Beni taunts right after the move connects but 
   can be canceled. 
10.RAIKOUKEN: Both versions will now only go forward. Negates projectiles 
   and some DMs. Beni taunts if the move connects but can be canceled.

   The window is tight but it can be done.
1. FUSENKYAKU: Lost the Fusen Gowan Ken as a followup. Can be combo from hard 
   attacks and chain into something else.
2. GEKIKEN: Light version immediately goes regardless of the button being 
   held. Hard version can be held down for more power. When fully charged 
   Shen's fists turn red and can either cause a guard crush (if blocked) 
   which can be followed up or a collapse if it hits which also can be 
   followed up. Pressing kick will stop shen from charging acting as a feint 
   but you cannot feint out of the move when fully charged.
3. TENRENKEN: Anti-air punch, light version can combo from light attacks 
   and keeps Shen stationary. While the hard version pushes shen forward a 
   little and can be combo from hard attacks. Hard version also has a juggle 
   property. As stated before Shen can use this move as follow up to his other
   3 special moves.
4. FUKKOGEKI: Overhead punch, cannot be combo from anything. Can use the 
   Kouryugeki as a followup as well as the Tenrenken.
5. DANKEN: Unblockable throw, there's a trick to his command instead of 
   doing hcb,f, you can actually use a qcb,f and the throw will also execute.
   This trick also works for Daimon and Elisabeth.
6. ZETSU GEKIKEN: Both versions are immune to all attacks and can be combo 
   from hard attacks.
7. TENKENREN~ZETSU GEKIKEN: This is a followup to the Tenkenren and you can 
   basically say it's like a super cancel. The timing is tight but you can 
   tell you did it if the super initiates right after the Tenkenren.
8. BAKUSHIN: Negates projectiles and comes out incredibly quick regardless 
   if you combo it or not. Have to input the buttons very fast for it to 
   execute but it is slightly easier if combo from a hard punch. No longer 
   gives Shen the strength bonus as it did from previous games.

#. Joe's crouching D is his old df + B Sliding command attack. It functions
   very similarly to his old crouching D in KOF '94/'95.
#. You can longer mash buttons to increase the damage of the Hizajigoku.
1. STEP IN MIDDLE KICK: Combos from light attacks and can be combo into.
2. HURRICANE UPPER: Mid level projectile that can be combo from light attacks,
   both versions run the full length of the screen now. Light version goes
   slower than the hard. Due to it's speed though you can't have two
   projectiles on screen.
3. SLASH KICK: Combos from light attacks. Light version travels about half 
   screen width while the hard version travels about 3/4 of the screen.
4. TIGER KICK: Anti Air kick, immune to attacks on start up. Light version 
   travels half screen width while the hard version travels about 3/4.
5. BAKURETSUKEN: Can combo off light attacks and is very close range. 
   Repeated presses will net you more hits.
6. BAKURETSUKEN FINISH: Finisher to the Bakuretsuken, should be done right 
   after Bakuretsuken starts otherwise it will whiff due it's poor range.
7. SCREW UPPER: Has a start up, but will take up the entire length of the 
   screen in front of Joe. Great for anti-airs and traps.

1. STRIKE ARCH: Overhead kick, can be canceled from hard attacks and is 
   cancelable afterwards.
2. BALTIC LAUNCHER: Projectile, light version comes out right in front of 
   Leona, while the hard version comes out diagonally upward. Comes out 
   rather slow so the only effective way to combo it in is after a CD in 
   the corner. Both versions have a juggle property.
3. MOON SLASHER: Anti air slash, both versions now leave Leona stationary. 
   This move can be combo from light attacks. Comes out quick but has 
   recovery time afterwards. The move does less damage when used at max 
   range of the slash.
4. EARRING EXPLOSIVE: Mid level projectile that turns to a ground level 
   when the earring bounces on the floor. Has a long start up, light version 
   reaches about half the screen and bounces twice on the floor. Hard version 
   reaches full width and bounces three times. Both versions have a juggle 
   property.
5. GRAND SABER: This move has altered quite a bit from the past. When the 
   move executes Leona will run a short distance depending on what kick button 
   was pressed. Light version makes her go forward while hard version makes 
   her dash back. From here you have two options, if you press the opposite 
   kick button that you used to execute the move Leona will dash in the 
   opposite direction. Great for stategic retreats and what not. Repeating 
   in this fashion you can make Leona run back and forth indefinatly. 
   Pressing punch while she dashes will execute the slash, if you are 
   running backwards she will still dash forward with the slash.
6. X-CALIBUR: Leona will now dive down from the air instead of throwing a 
   short range projectile. Light version makes her dive at 30 degree angle 
   while the hard version makes her dive from a 45 degree angle. Noticable 
   amount of recovery if the slash has been blocked. Can also be executed 
   with a lax motion.
7. V-SLASHER: Similar to her X-Calibur, light version will make her dive 
   at a 30 degree angle and the hard version will make her dive from a 45 
   degree angle. During a CC you can execute this move like a standing attack 
   without having to jump in the air.

#. Athena's far C is cancelable, unlike other characters.
1. PHOENIX BOMB: Chains from hard attacks on the ground. It can also be done 
   in the air and chains from light attacks in that fashion. Can also be 
   canceled into with special moves and normal attacks.
2. PSYCHO BALL ATTACK: Mid level projectile, light version comes out faster 
   but travels slower, hard version has a start up but travels faster. It's 
   possible to have two projectiles on screen at one time.
3. PSYCHO SWORD: Anti air attack, no longer can be done in the air anymore. 
   This move can be combo from light attacks. Light version hits 3 times and 
   is lower to the ground. Hard version hits 5 times but travels higher in 
   the air increasing recovery time.
4. PSYCHO REFLECTOR: Just as a note, this move can be done using qcb+K. I'm 
   not sure if this in error in the game's command list. The actual reflector 
   does not hit, but can counter all forms of striking attacks: Normals, 
   projectiles, etc, regardless of range of the attack. When it reflects 
   Athena's reflector produces a Psycho Ball that knocksdowns.
5. PHOENIX ARROW: Light version of this hits twice without the sweep kick 
   finish. Hard version hits 3 times with a sweep kick finish, this increases
   the recovery time if blocked though.
6. SHINING CRYSTAL BIT: This completely wraps Athena in an aura. So no more 
   slightly open spots like before when the smaller crystal bits would come 
   out. If the attack makes contact, either blocked or hit, will end the move. 
   It can be canceled prematurely by pressing AC.

#. Even though Kensou has no command moves his Ryuutouda and Rintesshoh act 
   like command moves.
1. RYUUTOUDA: Combos off light attacks can be combo into special moves.
2. RINTESSHOH: Combos off hard attacks can be chained from a Ryuutouda and 
   then combo from other special moves.
3. SIKKUZANRYUUKYAKU: Kensou runs with jumping kick, light version makes 
   Kensou run half width of the screen while hard version makes him run 3/4.
   If Kensou is not within range he will only run without an attack. Can be
   combo from hard attacks and off the Ryuutouda and Rintesshoh. If this 
   move is blocked Kensou will jump back to an unsafe distance.
4. RYUUBOKKO: Combos off hard attacks only, when this move executes you have
   to mash punch to increase the amount of hits and damage. There is 4 </pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
   different levels to this move depending on the number of presses you 
   input:
   > Level 1: No presses, Kensou hits 4 times.
   > Level 2: Few presses, Kensou hits 8 times.
   > Level 3: Many presses, Kensou hits 12 times and does a final hit total 13
              hits and a knockdown.
   > Level 4: Even more presses, Kensou hits 17 times but starts to slow down
              at the end. He gets tired and forces himself to rest, you can 
              NOT cancel out of this and Kensou is wide open for attack 
              afterwards.
5. RYUUGAKUSAI: Anti-air attack, light version does 2 hits and is lower to 
   the ground, while the hard version does 4 hits and leaves Kensou higher up 
   increasing his recovery.This can be chained off the Ryuutouda and 
   Rintesshoh.
6. CHOUKYUUDAN: DM Projectile, very big and slow moving. Can be negated by 
   other DM projectiles.

1. GENMUKYAKU: On the ground Duo kicks his foot in the floor, this now tracks 
   on to the opponent no matter the distance. Combos from light attacks. The 
   air version is his jumping B but with extended range and hits as an 
   overhead.
2. MAE: Duo teleports a short distance and can cross sides with his opponent.
   Light version travels very fast but covers little distance. Hard version 
   travels a little further. Duo is not safe which this teleport and can be 
   hit out of it. Can be linked after the Shakijyuuryuu 3rd hit.
3. USHIRO: Duo now has a teleport that goes backwards and it shares mostly 
   the same properties as Mae but has a slightly longer start up. This version
   can't be linked from Shakijyuuryuu.
4. GENMUKEN: Looks like Duo's standing A but with longer range can be combo 
   off light attacks. Air version has a very similar property.
5. SHAKIJYUURYUU: This move has been simplified, now exclusively comes off 
   Duo's standing C. It can't be chained in any other sort of way. Last hit
   knocksdown and has a juggle property.
6. GENMUBAKKOSHIKON: Similar to Iori's Yaotome, Duo can slide under 
   projectiles and other high level attacks. He can be hit out of the move 
   though. Does a no recovery knockdown if the move connects.

#. After a Far D, if you hold D down Chin will go into the Choukaroh.
1. ZABANTETSU: One of chin's stances, he stays very low to the ground ducking
   under mid level projectiles and high level attacks. Can cancel into any of
   this special moves from this stance.
2. CHOUKAROH: The 2nd of Chin's stances, Chin stands up with one leg. From here
   you can do a variety of options. Chin can hop forward and backwards by
   pressing forward and backwards respectively. Pressing A will jab and cancel
   out of the stance. Pressing C will do his Getsugasoushu. Pressing B,B will
   do his Nikiyaku, and pressing D will do his forward D which will go back to
   the stance again. You can also jump to cancel out of stance. Pressing down 
   will go into his Zabantetsu.
3. KAIJYO: As far as I am concerned I believe this is only a taunt that can be
   canceled out of. Also another way to cancel out of Choukaroh.
4. SUIHO: Comes out quick and works as a decent anti air attack. Can be combo
   from light attacks. Has a taunt animation after contact but can be canceled
   out of.
5. RYU SOGEKI: Counter attack, counters all ground level attacks. Air attacks
   won't work. When Chin gets hit he will do his close D. Doesn't work on 
   projectiles.
6. URONKOUCHUU: Overhead kick, holding on to D will act as a feint. When this
   connects, pressing P will go into his Getsugasoushu. This will retain its
   overhead property when comboed from hard attacks.
7. NIKIYAKU: Two part kick, can combo off light attacks. The first kick has
   a juggle property. Pressing down after the first kick will go into the
   Zabantetsu.
8. GETSUGASOUSHU: Followup to the Zabantetsu, can be combo into any of Chin's
   specials and also to his DM which acts as a super cancel. This can also be
   linked to either of his two stances.
9. TOUKUUHITENHOH: Reaches about 3/4 width of the screen, can be combo from
   light attacks. Has quite a bit of recovery on block.

   Critical Counter Initiator: close C

1. JET UPPER: Combos off light attacks and can be combo into. Close range so 
   you have to do this move fairly close.
2. VULCAN PUNCH:  No longer knocks down. Now hits multiple times instead of 
   just once like in XI. You still have to mash this move fairly fast on it's
   own. In combos it is a lot easier to get out. Combos off light attacks.
3. BURNING HAMMER: Light version combos off hard attacks. Hard version has 
   full auto guard until the punch comes out. When the punch connects the 
   opponent stays stunned long enough for followups.
4. EXPLOSIVE RALF PUNCH: Light version comes out quick and can be combo from
   light attacks, but the explosion is very small. Hard version has a start 
   up but has a much larger explosion that also has a juggle combination. 
5. GALACTICA PHANTOM: Comes out much faster than in previous versions. Can 
   be combo off hard/command attacks. The move is a lot weaker now and is no 
   longer unblockable. On block it will guard crush but the move recovers too
   slowly for any followups.

1. GIANT BOMB: Has full auto guard when he readys himself, but can be hit 
   during the actual tackle. Light version comes out faster and covers about
   1/2 screen width. Hard version comes out longer increasing it's autoguard
   and covers the whole screen. Pressing BD while Raiden readies himself will
   feint the move.
2. DOKUGIRI: Close range projectile. Light version comes out quicker and 
   can be combo from hard attacks. Hard version comes out very slow and 
   can't be combo with nothing short of a counter hit.
3. RAIDEN BOMB: Anti Air throw, does not hit standing opponents at all.
4. HEAD CRUSH: Command throw, can be combo off light attacks. Swaps sides 
   and causes a no recovery knockdown.
5. SUPER RAIDEN DROP: Command throw, can be combo off light attacks. Better 
   range than Raiden's other throws. Causes a no recovery knockdown.

#. Clark has the only air throw in the game. His throw can be combo after 
   any move that launches the opponent in the air.
1. JET UPPER: Pretty much the same move as Ralf. Combos off light attacks and 
   can be combo into his other special moves.
2. STEP: Clark does a quick dash at the opponent. This can be combo off normal
   attacks to close the gap. It can also be used to surprise the opponent due 
   to it's speed.
3. SUPER ARGENTINE BACKBREAKER: Command throw, can be combo from light attacks.
   Has a followup with the flashing elbow which is the only the over the
   ground move in the game. Remember that the throw swaps sides with the
   opponent so reverse the qcf motion as directed.
4. VULCAN PUNCH: Similar to Ralf but Clark's version knocks down. Can be combo 
   from light attacks.
5. ULTRA ARGENTINE BACKBREAKER: Command throw, has the same property as the 
   Super Argentine but does more damage and doesn't swap sides.

#. Terry's close C hits twice and boths hits are cancelable.
#. Terry can only initiate a Counter Combo on the first hit of a close C.
1. RISING UPPER: Combos off normal attacks, can be combo into any of Terry's 
   special moves. Window is a bit tight however.
2. BACK KNUCKLE: Also combos off normal attacks, but can't be combo into 
   anything else.
3. POWER WAVE: Ground-level projectile, Light version is slower than the hard
   version. It is possible to have two projectiles on screen at the same time.
4. BURNING KNUCKLE: Light version travels 1/2 screen width while the hard
   version travels 3/4 of the screen. Hard version has a startup and can only
   be combo off Terry's CD attack.
5. CRACK SHOOT: No longer knocks down standing opponents like in XI. Light 
   version does only one hit now, while the hard version does up to 3. Both 
   versions have a taunt animation that can be canceled out of. Has a longer 
   start up than before. 
6. RISING TACKLE: Anti-air attack, combos off light attacks. Light version 
   hits once and travels lower in the air. While the hard version hits 3 times
   and travels higher in the air increasing it's recovery time. Hard version 
   also has a taunt animation that can be canceled out of.
7. POWER GEYSER: Comes out fast now with an even larger hit box. The geyser
   can not be negated. Both versions are now performed at the same speed.

#. Daimon's old Zujou Barai is now his crouching C attack.
1. TENCHIGAESHI: Unblockable throw with great range. Despite what the command
   list says this move can be done with a qcb,f instead of a hcb,f. Can be 
   combo off light attacks, and does a no recovery knockdown.
2. CHOUUKEMI: Very similar to your basic roll. Hard version goes a little 
   further than the light but neither version can pass through the opponent. 
   Can be combo from normals to put the pressure on the opponent.
3. JIRAISHIN: Low based ground pound, it's range is the full length of the
   screen. If the opponent isn't blocking low they will be hit. Can be jumped
   over very easily. Hard version is used as a feint.
4. KUMOTSUKAMINAGE: Blockable throw, used as an anti air attack. This move
   also has full auto guard. Can hit some tall standing opponents.
5. KIRIKABUGAESHI: Blockable throw, this move now has full auto guard. Can
   only be combo from hard attacks. 
6. GOKURAKUOTOSHI: Unblockable thow that has even better range than his
   Tenchigaeshi. Can be combo off light attacks, and does a no recovery
   knockdown. Has a taunt animation that can NOT be canceled out of.

2. JOUDANUKE: One of two parries Ryo has. This parries high/middle range

   parrying something.
3. GEDANUKE: The 2nd of the two parries, parries low range attacks. has the 
   same properties as the Joudanuke.
4. KOOHKEN: Close range projectile, hard version goes out a little further 
   than the light version.
5. KOHOU: Anti air attack, light version does 1 hit and stays low in the air.
   Hard version does 2 hits and leaves Ryo higher in the air increasing his 
   recovery. Can be combo off light attacks.
6. HIENSHIPPUKYAKU: Light version comes out quicker and can be combo from 
   light attacks. Hard version comes out slower but has a followup kick 
   that has a juggle property to it.
7. ZANRETSUKEN: No longer has the start up auto guard to it anymore. Can be 
   combo off light attacks, after the move finishes Ryo taunts which can 
   NOT be canceled out of.
8. RYUUKORANBU: Autocombo DM, can be hit out of startup. Ryo is invincible
   during the dash though. Very similar to Roberts' except for the no 
   recovery knockdown.
9. HAOUSHOUKOUKEN: DM projectile, pretty much the same move as Roberts'.
   Can be negated with other DM projectiles.
