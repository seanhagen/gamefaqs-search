Get as many points as possible by destroying aliens with your 
shooter/laser.  Make sure that the aliens don't land; they'll cost you 
one shooter.  If you loose all six shooters, it's a game over for you!

You just need to choose if you want to do a real game or practice. 
(Practice is just a slower version of a game...)

Time to play!

Your goal is to destroy all 32 (4x8) aliens on the screen with your 
laser shooter.  You have six shooters to do this; if any of the aliens 
land or destroy you with one of their shots, you loose a laser.

To protect you, you have three shields.  The aliens can destroy these, 
but it does take them a while to do so.

...so, as you can see, this is a rather simplistic game to play... but 
pretty fun!
