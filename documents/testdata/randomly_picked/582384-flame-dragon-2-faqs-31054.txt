===================
 Game Informations
===================

Flame Dragon series were landmark classic in Chinese computer game history.

Flame Dragon 2 - Legend of Golden Castle was released in 1995. It is said to be
the climax of the whole series. Storyline, characters, battle and graphics are
considered to be excellent even now.

Flame Dragon is created by Dynasty International Information Co., Ltd. English
version of this game is never made. Since so many non-Chinese players enjoy
this game, this walkthrough will help them understand the storyline better and
have a easier time in the game.

The game difficulty is not very high, a player can normally beat the game first
time playing it. But without a walkthrough it is impossible to get all secrets
and bonus levels, and game will get very challenging after chapter 20.

The purpose of this walkthrough is helping those who need hints for getting the
secrets, raising characters and strategies throughout the chapters. Also this
walkthrough will include translations of dialogues in the game to help people
do not understand Chinese gain some understanding about the storyline.

The basic formation of this walkthrough is constructed. The chapter walkthrough
section is still under progress. So far there are 4 complete chapters out of 30
chapters. I am open for any suggestions concerning the walkthrough format.


===========================================
 Introduction: How to use this walkthrough
===========================================

In each Chapter I will include translations of dialogues. The names of all the
characters in Flame Dragon are originally English names. They change them into
Chinese by using the pronouncing of the names. So by reversing this step we get
common English names. I want to clarify that this walkthrough isn't a official
document from Dynasty International. So if one day Dynasty suddenly wants to
translate this game, don't make any comparison to this walkthrough.

I will write strategies for each chapters to help readers. For each chapter
there will be a Item Coordinate Section indicating the locations for obvious or
hidden treasures.

There are over 30 characters in this game. In the later part of the game you
can only use maximally 20 characters in one chapters. Many players have trouble
choosing which character to use. To solve this problem, for every chapter which
has new character joining in I will have a New Character Analyse Section.

At last this walkthrough will provide you two ways to play this game:

Get all the secrets and go through each chapter according to the mission given.
This is what people normally do. With secrets in the game given you can easily
have 5 to 8 strong characters and with the correct strategies given you can
easily pass through any chapter.

Go Extreme!
This is my way, and I suggest you to try it too. In this option, you have to
spend some extra time, but your reward is unbelievable. I don't have to
describe anything about it just now. For each chapter I will put in Go Extreme
Section. And by then you will understand what I mean.

Thor, prince of Lotoria. His father is Reter who leads the kingdom of Lotoria.
This day he walks into the Palace, as he approaches the throne of Reter the
King and Millin the Queen...

Thor:   (knee down) Father, I am here as you summoned.
Reter:  Here you are, son. Don't be restrained, come closer.
Thor:   Thanks, father.
Reter:  Come. Let me take a good look at you. I was so busy with my duty
        lately, haven't seen you for quite a while.
Millin: Yes, we haven't been together like a family for so long.
Thor:   Yes. (Walk in front of his parents)
Reter:  Time has passed fast, you have grown strong! All my ministers and
        generals are talking about what a strong and brave warrior you have
        become. I think it is time to decide the next king of this kingdom.
Thor:   Right, it must be my brother Dean. I cannot be happier about this.
Reter:  No Thor. I am thinking about having you being the king of Lotoria.
Thor:   Ah? Me? The king?
Reter:  Yes, Thor. Do you have any objects?
Thor:   No, father. But I do not have the blood of king in me. I should not be
        the king instead of Dean.
Reter:  Thor, now is the time belongs to the strong ones. Only the one that is
        strong can lead the army and protect peace and happiness within his
        country. Lotoria needs a strong king, that's why I have chosen you!
        You are the one and only one to be the king!
Thor:   But Dean is also...
Reter:  Dean is different from you. You both have loving hearts, he is a smart
        kid but he doesn't have the strength to put on plates armour and fight
        in battles. He can also be a good king given the circumstance. But for
        now you are the one for this place. I hope you can understand for the
        sake of people in Lotoria.
Millin: Thor, all these years we have treat you just like our own son, so it
        makes no difference to us whether you or Dean being the king. This is
        something we decided after careful consideration. I hope you can
        understand.
Thor:   I... I...
Reter:  I know this is hard for you. How about his, consider this for 3 days
        then come back and tell us what you decide. Of course you know the
        answer I wish to hear. You can go now.
Thor:   Yes father. (left the palace)

Carrying the burden of the new duty, Thor is lying on grassland outside the
city. Alex, his close friend found him.

Alex: Ha! There you are! Can't believe you are taking a nap. This is not you
      style at all!
Thor: (speechless)
Alex: What happened? You seem a little depressed.
Thor: (sigh)
Alex: Whoa, something really isn't right! We need to talk.

Alex walks closer to Thor

Alex: So, tell me what is bothering you.
Thor: (sigh) it is nothing.
Alex: Nothing! There are not many things can make you depressed. Tell me what
      happened.
Thor: Father wants me to be the next king of Lotoria.
Alex: What?!
Thor: Father wants me to be the next king of Lotoria!
Alex: Oh, but why are you so depressed for. We should celebrate about this.
Thor: Ah you idiot. I can't believe after being friends for so long, you cannot
      understand.
Alex: What do you mean?
Thor: I don't want to be the king! I will have to stay in that palace and listen
      to those ministers blabbing about this and that. What so fun about that?
Alex: I guess you have a point...
Thor: I never want to be a king and sit in the throne all my life. I want to be
      an adventurer. Go to the places nobody has been. I am father's foster son.
      I always thought Dean would be the king. But all of sudden, it fell on me!
Alex: Did you accept?
Thor: Father told me to give him the answer after 3 days. Can I even say "NO"?
Alex: Yeah, sorry I cannot help in this one.
Thor: If you want to help, let's go and practise. Maybe I will feel better after
      some fighting.
Alex: No problem let's go!

Thor and Alex go to an open area.

Thor: Let's start! I lost to you yesterday, I will get you back!
Alex: Ha, you often beat me, what's the matter with letting me win once.
Thor: Wrong! Father said, you have to keep fighting to get stronger.
Alex: Geez, look at this sunny day. Why cannot you just lie down and enjoy it?
Thor: Fine, I will go find the guards to practise.

Alex suddenly discovers something.

Alex: Hey! What is it over there?
Thor: Huh?

Thor looks over and sees a girl lying outside the forest, beside her there is a
giant robot standing.

Thor: Ah, someone is in trouble.
Alex: yeah, and what is that big giant doing there?
Thor: Go check it out.

Thor and Alex go near, the robot stops them.

Gaia: Please stop or I will have to begin defensive procedures.
Alex: Huh?
Girl: (Getting up) Ah¡­
Alex: Oh, she is awake.
Thor: Let me take a look.

Robot moves out of the way, Thor goes near the girl.

Thor: Miss, are you all right?
Girl: Who are you? Where am I?
Thor: This is the land Lotoria, my name is Thor. What is your name?
Girl: My name is, I think it is Yoni. How did I get here?
Thor: Yoni, good name. You don't know where you came from?
Yoni: I am sorry, but I only remember I came from somewhere really far away.
      (to the robot) Gaia?
Gaia: Yes master?
Yoni: Where did we come from?
Gaia: (looks around and finally point at a direction) Judging from my movement
      history, we are from that direction.
Alex: Oh I understand, you are from land of Mara. I heard from my father. It is
      a land far away from here.
Thor: So are you from that place?
Yoni: I, I don't remember. It is, Ah! It is a nightmare!
Thor: Yoni?
Yoni: Take me back home, can you? Please.
Thor: All right, don't worry, we will take you home.
Alex: Hey hey. Are you serious?
      (walk beside Thor) Mara is a completely different world. You are going
      there just because this girl?
Thor: Yes! I am going. Alex, do you know how to get there?
Alex: All right, all right. I will go ask my father.
Thor: Good. go prepare some necessary baggage for me, I will go tell my father
      about it.
Alex: I am going too. After all I am your friend, I cant just let you go all by
      yourself.
Thor: Thanks, Alex.
Alex: No problem. I will talk to you father about it, you can take Yoni to back
      to let her rest a bit.

- Chapter One - First Battle                                                  -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---Item Coordinate---

(1, 11): 5000 gold [Hidden]
(4, 13): 3000 gold
(8, 14): Herb Medicine

---Dialogue---

The journey begins. Alex, Thor, Yoni, and Gaia take a ship and they arrive on
an small island.

Thor: Phew that took long. Let's rest here for a while.
Alex: Father said after crossing this sea, we will be at Mara. We can rest for
      a while until the sea raise again.
Thor: Great. Yoni, are you tired from this all these ship riding.
Yoni: I am fine, it's comfortable here. The wind is so soft.
Gaia: (sensing something)!!!

Pirates appears.

Pirate One: Hey, there are some idiots resting on this island. Free
            merchandises for us.
Pirate Two: Go tell our boss. We will take care of them.

One pirate left.

Thor:       Hmm, Alex. What are those birds screaming about?
Alex:       I heard they are pirates.
Thor:       Pirates? So... they want to rob us?
Alex:       Rob? I heard they kill, steal, rob. There is nothing they dont do.
Thor:       Ha, I have no problem if they want to do some exercises. But want
            to rob us? Haha. Alex? Ready for some movements.
Alex:       Of course, my hands are itchy already.
Pirate:     Hey listen you idiots, give us your money and that hot chick, and
            we may spare you.
Yoni:       Hot chick? Are they talking about me?
Alex:       Ah, they, uh..
Thor:       Bastards, you will pay for not watching your tongues.
Pirate One: Oh? You want to resist?
Pirate Two: Very well, we will just have to kill hem all.

---Strategy---

This is the first chapter, so it is not challenging at all. Right now, Thor is
the weakest character, since Gaia has high defense, Yoni uses magic attacks,
Alex can do range attack, Thor is the only one without any specialties. Try to
kill the enemies fast, but don't have to rush things. The best thing to do is
having Alex or Gaia weaken an enemy then Thor finish him off. Yoni can kill any
one with one Burning Magic. You should be able to finish off the three pirates
in first 2 to 3 rounds. After you finish third rounds:

---Dialogue---

A young man walks out the door holding an axe.

Harold: Dad, dad.

Another older man walks out.

Hart:   Uh, why is it so noisy outside?! What are they doing?
Harold: Bunch of people are fighting outside.
Hart:   Huh? Let me see. Ah-ha! Those pirates are trying to rob the passengers
        again. How dare they do their business in front of MY house!
Harold: What do we do, dad?
Hart:   Son, this is the perfect time to practise yourself. Let's go and help
        them.
        (Thor sees Harold and Hart coming)
Thor:   Hey old guy, what are you doing outside. Stay away if you dont want to
        get hurt.
Hart:   Dont worry young man, we are here to help you take care of pirates.
Thor:   What? Ah, it is just a little pirate. We can handle, you can go back
        your house.
Alex:   Thor. At least they mean well, cant you just say something nice?
Thor:   All right, well then.. Hey old guy, if you want to help, I appreciate
        it.
Hart:   (to Harold) hear that son? Let's go!
Harold: Yes dad!

---Strategy---

You have two new characters to control. Hart has very high damage which allows
him to kill anyone with one hit, but he will not join you after this chapter.
So don't use Hart to kill anyone and waste the experience, just let him pick
up the two money treasure. Harold has high damage too, highest damage beside
his father, but he has the lowest defense (2 only). Right now you should pair
Alex and Thor up, Gaia and Harold up. One round after:

---Dialogue---

Four pirates arrive from south east.

Pirate One:    Hey, seem like they have troubles taking care of the business.
Pirate Two:    Let's go!
               (After one more round, pirate leader appears with four more
               pirates)
Pirate Leader: What the hell is wrong with you people? You cant even take care
               of little kids like that. I have to come and finish the work.
               Ha, what a joke!
Thor:          Hey, who is this ugly and annoying idiot, what does he want?
Alex:          He seems like the leader. Finally someone worth me to fight
               seriously for. I will take him.
Thor:          What are you talking about? For this kind of guy, I am the one
               to do the job. Let me take him!
Alex:          Hey Thor, dont be excited ok? Cant believe you want to show off
               this badly in front a Yoni.
Thor:          Hey! What does that suppose to mean?! Watch what you are saying!
Pirate Leader: Hey, what are you two yelling about? You have plenty time for
               this after I send you to hell.
Thor:          Shut up! Can't you see we are talking here!?
Alex:          Thor, this guy is quite annoying. Maybe we should burst his butt
               first. We will argue later.
Thor:          All right, I agree.
Pirate Leader: What the?! Damn it! How dare you kids underestimate me! Kill
               them all, let none survive!
               (One round later, four patrol soldiers arrive)
Soldier One:   Hey, pirates are robbing passengers again. This is the time for
               us to show them what we, the Ocean Shore Division made of!
Thor:          Whoa, today is quite a blast. Who are you guys?
Soldier Two:   We belong to the kingdom of Arks, our duty is to portal across
               the ocean and protect the passengers. These pirates are our
               responsibility, please leaven them to us!
Thor:          Dont bother! Cant you see we are enjoy ourselves here?
Alex:          Thor, at least remember you are in their country now. Be polite
               to their officers.
Soldier One:   Dont worry about it, we are coming.

--- Strategy---

Like Thor said, this is quite a blast. By now you should have finish off all
enemies from at the top. Surround and kill the rest of the pirates with the
Arks soldiers. Remember dont get any of you character killed. Also if Harold is
killed Hart will not be in your control any more. Try not to let the soldiers
kill too many pirates. The pirate leader is a little tougher, but Yoni can make
him near dead with one strike of Burning Flame. Try to kill him before he has a
chance to attack anyone. As the Pirate Leader is defeated:

---Dialogue---

Pirate Leader: Damn it. First I got these tough kids, then busted by the portal
               soldiers. This is my worst day. Ah..!

After all pirates are defeated.

Alex:   thank you, Hart and Harold, also you guys from the Arks. Because of you
        all, we can take care of pirates this fast.
Hart:   It is nothing, we normally live on this island and sometimes go out and
        do some trading. It is quite boring. Helping you kill pirates is
        nothing. By the way, I have a favour to ask you all.
Alex:   What is it?
Hart:   My son is also a young man like you guys, I hope he can go with you to
        some places and gain some knowledge. I have taught him some feat since
        he was little, I am sure he can be some help.
Thor:   Hmm...
Alex:   Of course, we agree, dont we Yoni?
Yoni:   Yeah, it will be nice with a new friend.
Hart:   Well thank you guys. Hey son, go say hello.
Harold: My... my name is Harold. Uh, nice to meet you.
Alex:   Welcome Harold. So you are a friend now, let's work together as a team
        from now on.
Harold: Ye... yes.
Hart:   Great, the sea is rising again. You guys should be on your way soon.
Thor:   All right, we will see you later.

---Go Extreme---

First make sure you get all the treasure, especially the two money treasure
because that 8000 gold can really help you at the beginning of the game. Don't
let any character die. In fact, don't ever let any characters die throughout
the game. Don't use Hart at all in this chapter, try to get so many kills as
you can before the soldiers kill the pirates.

---New Character Analyse---

Thor
He is the main character of the storyline, also the weakest character at the
beginning. However you should definitely do what it takes to keep him levelling
up. Later on he will upgrade into new class. If you choose Sword Master he will
get the strongest special skill in the whole game: Dragon Strike! If you choose
the legendary Hero class... Thor will gain the most powerful Lighting magic,
the most powerful Fire magic, best Holy magic, decent Healing magic, and the
VERY useful Teleport magic... long story short: Thor will go nuts.
Badge of Bravery is needed for Thor to become Hero. It will be found in Chapter
13.

Yoni
She is the heroine of the storyline. She is a decent Fire magic caster at
beginning. She can cast some assistant spell as well. The upgrading for Yoni is
very important. If she is upgraded into an ArchMage she will have powerful fire
magic and nothing more. If she is upgraded into the Summoner she will have all
spells she can have as ArchMage, also 4 legendary summoning spells that other
characters can never get:
God of Destruction: Best boosting spell. Increase Damage, defense, veracity,
                    and evasion rate, cover HUGE area. This spell can turn the
                    entire team into a storm of death.
Demon of Shadow:    Most powerful abnormal spell. Cover HUGE area, make enemies
                    poisoned, paralysised, casting-sealed.
Fairy of Wind:      Best healing magic. Heal about 1000 HP for HUGE area.
Seraph the Wrath:   Most powerful attack magic in the game and period. HUGE
                    area again, over 1000 (sometimes breaks 2000) damage. Yoni
                    has the powerful to turn a screen of enemies into dusts.
Also will get damage and defense that can match a warrior, and the highest
evasion and magic defense in the whole game.
To become the summoner, Yoni needs Covenant of Fairy. It can be found in
Chapter 15.

Alex
He is a powerful character throughout the game. High damage, high defense, high
mobility, I don't know what else do you want out of a character. If you upgrade
him into Dragon Knight, he will gain even higher mobility without geographical
limitation. If you upgrade him into Paladin Knight, he will gain higher magical
defense and officially become the best meat shield of the team.
Dragon Egg is needed for Alex to become a Dragon Knight. It can be found in
many places throughout the chapters.

Gaia
Gaia can't be upgraded, but he can level up to 99. He has decent magic defense,
outstanding damage and defense. If you level him up regularly, he can be very
reliable in any chapter of the game.

Harold
He is a decent warrior. Outstanding damage allows him to be the striker at the
beginning. But his low defense and magic defense can be a problem at the
beginning. Upgrading into Holy Warrior with improve him at many aspects. He
will truely shine if he become a Berserker, he'll get high damage, good defense
and magic defense, even some healing spell for emergency use.
Badge of Platina is needed for Harold to become a Berserker. It can be found in
Chpater 7.

---Dialogue---

Everyone enters town of Rod.

Alex:   Finally we arrive at town of Rod. I heard this is one of the busiest
        along the shore. We can have a good rest here. Also gather some
        information about our next destiny.
Thor:   (look around) Alex, I don't think your information is correct. There
        isn't a single person in this place, this is like a ghost town.
Yoni:   So scary...
Harold: This is strange. My father and I came here to buy drinks few days ago.
        This town was still very busy back then. How come...

Couple town people came out of a building and saw Thor.

Town People: Ah! Bandits are here, run!
Thor:        Wait! We are not bandits.
Town People: You are not? Then why are you here for?
Alex:        We are just passing by and trying to get some information. What
             happened, maybe we can help.
Town People: Ai, what can you kids do. The bandits announced to rob this town,
             so everybody has left. We came back to take some belongings with
             us, we are about to leave now. You guys better run away too, dont
             let those bandits get you.
Gaia:        ..!!!

A group of bandits arrive.

Bandit One:  All right, we arrived right on time. Huh? There is still someone
             here.
Town People: Ah! They are here! We are dead meat!
Bandit One:  Didn't we told you? There should be nobody here when we arrive.
             Are you people idiots?
Town People: Please, allow us to leave now. Spare our lives.
Alex:        Hey Thor. Don't you think these bandits are too savage. Why don't
             we teach them a lesson?
Thor:        What lesson? That won't be necessary! We should send them all to
             hell!
Harold:      I agree.
Bandit Two:  Hey, those kids want to kill us.
Bandit One:  OHHHH. I am SO scared.
Bandit Two:  Well then, we will play with them for a while.

--- Strategy---

You have to make sure at least one of all town people survives. This is a very
easy chapter, easier than the first one. Go left and fight the bandits, pick up
the treasures on the way. You probably got the high damage weapon for Alex, but
DONT use it! You get same experience for killing an enemy no matter how much HP
he had left. It is a waste to let Alex kill a full-life bandit with one hit.
Pair up like last chapter: Alex hits first, then Thor finishes the work; Gaia
hits first, then Harold makes the kill. Yoni still has her powerful magic
attack. Note that if you get the good weapon for Yoni from secret shop, her
physical damage will be enough to go toe-to-toe with a bandit. during the third
round:

---Dialogue---

New group of bandits arrive

Bandit One:  Huh? Shouldn't they finish the work already? What are they doing
             now?
Bandit Two:  They are fighting with some kids.
Bandit One:  Hey there are some idiots running this way, finish them off first.
Town People: Help, more bandits are here!
Alex:        Damn, didn't expect they would come from the other entrance too.
Thor:        We have to save those innocent people.
Alex:        What shall we do then?
Thor:        (to town people) Hey you guys. Run to the south-east side!
Town People: All right, everyone run to the south-east corner.

--- Strategy---

The new group is bandits are a bit stronger, but there still shouldn't be any
problems. All the town people will run to the right-bottom corner. Have your
group go up, all bandits will forget about the town folks and focus on you.
Kill them all, dont forget the treason.

---Dialogue---

Town People: Thanks to you people, our town is saved.

A girl holding a bow runs out of a building.

Shelia: Nice! Great fight!
Thor:   Oh? Where did this crazy girl come from?
Shelia: Hey! Be a little polite, I am not crazy. I was watching the whole
        fight, that was incredible!
Alex:   Whoa, you certainly got some guts. Is there anything we can do for you?
Shelia: Nothing much. I just want to ask, you people are all amazing and
        experienced warriors. You are not here just for fighting some bandits,
        right?
Thor:   Oh, we want to cure this girl. She lost her memory and we want to take
        her back home.
Shelia: How did that happen?
Thor:   Well, we found her outside a forest. She name is Yoni.
Shelia: You found her?
Thor:   Yeah, she lost her memory. But we believe she came for land of Mara,
        maybe she is even a princess of some country. So we took her here.
Shelia: Really? This land only has one nation: The Arks. There is only one
        princess and she is...
Alex:   What?
Shelia: Nothing. I know who can cure and help her to find the lost memory. I
        can take you guys to her. But there is one condition.
Thor:   What is it? We will deal with it.
Shelia: Simple, you must take me with you.
Alex:   Uh...
Thor:   This isnt a funny thing to do. A young girl like you following us...
        You can get yourself in trouble.
Shelia: Hey, underestimating me will get you in trouble. So do you agree?
Harold: Thor, we don't know when will the bandits return. It is dangerous to
        leave a young lady like her here. Maybe we should take her with us.
Alex:   Yeah Thor. We must find a way to cure Yoni. It is just one more person,
        no big deal.
Thor:   All right, but listen carefully lady. You are our guide, so don't cause
        any troubles. All right?
Shelia: No problem, let's go! This way, come on.
Thor:   Ai...

---Go Extreme---

Logically you can start crazy levelling right now, but it isnt going to be
efficient anyway. I suggest waiting until level 4. Just remember to not kill
any enemy with a hit. Also you can try to save ALL the town people. They will
then give you a Power Elixir.

---New Character Analyse---

Shelia
She is your first archer, and eventually will be your best. Her damage is a
little low at the beginning. You need to intentionally help her level up.
Upgrade her into a Marksman, I mean Markswoman. She will be a powerful
character later.
Shelia can only become a Sniper without Book of Eye and Heart. It can be found
in Chapter 7.

---Dialogue---

They comes to one side of a bridge

Shelia: We will arrive at Sara Village soon after crossing this bridge. The
        priest in that village has amazing healing power. She would be able to
        help Yoni get her memory back.
Thor:   Hopefully... Huh?

One man with white hair appears at the other side of the bridge. He is carrying
a sword and seems to be running from somebody.

Man: Pew... I think I lost them...

Large group of soldiers appears.

Soldier: There you are, Dino! Where do you think you are going?
Dino:    What do you all have against me? Why do you have to kill me?
Soldier: You can ask our capital. Of course only if you can live that long.
Dino:    Damn it! Then I will fight to my last breath!
Shelia:  Hey, they are fighting on the bridge.
Thor:    Hum! So many soldiers gang up on one guy! How fair is that? Alex! We
         will help the white-hair guy!
Alex:    Hold on! We dont even know what is going on yet? Dont you think...
Thor:    Just listen to the way those soldiers speak! They are definitely the
         bad guys here. Look, Alex. I am going. Are you coming or not?
Alex:    Ok! Ok! I am going! How can I watch while you have all the fun? Geez...
Shelia:  Me too! Me too!
Harold:  All right!

--- Strategy---

This is the first chapter that involve rescuing and it is not easy! Dino can
take maximal 6 hits from the soldiers with full health, and only when the
soldiers are not doing deadly strikes. Dino will take at least 4 hits per round.
He will be healing himself every single round. As the fighting begins, let Alex
run into the battle right away. Kill the inured soldiers fast. Soldiers in this
chapter are basically at the same level comparing to the bandits from last
chapter. So they are pretty weak. Get everyone run up. Dont let your guard down
after most of the soldiers are down. Because after 2 rounds:

---Dialogue---

A group of soldiers appear from the north side of the bridge. Another group of
soldiers appear from the south side of the bridge with their capital.

Capital: Dino! Just like we expected, you are quite a strong fighter. It is not
         surprising that you can live this long. That is why my boss asked me
         to finish the job. Your luck ends here!
Dino:    You gave me too much credit. I would be dead long ago if it is not
         these youngsters. But since you are here, answer me: who sent all of
         you after me?
Capital: Very well, it will not matter anyway. General Grey sent us to finish
         you off.
Shelia:  Grey? Are you talking about that small-minded loyal guard general? Is
         this about him losing that girl to a swordsman?
Dino:    Oh? How do you know this?
Shelia:  Secret! But dont worry, we will help you!
Capital: Damn you all! Whoever helps Dino will be slain! Especially you know
         about this secret.

--- Strategy---

Dont compare this Capital to the Pirate Leader in the first level! Trust me!
You do not want ANYONE take ANY hit from him! Finish him off in 1 round by
using Yoni's burning fire, Shelia and Alex's range attack, then use Harold or
Thor to finish the work. Dino is another concern. He would run into battlefield
if there is a target within 5 blocks and his life is not very low. And when he
does, he will be killed. So keep any enemies away from him. If you notice the 2
holes on the bridge where you cant walk on, use it to pick the enemy two by two.
As the capital is defeated:

---Dialogue---

Capital: How can I lose to a bunch of kids...? General Grey...
Dino:    Thank you, everyone. There is no way I could have escape from this
         without your help. But Grey will not give up. There is no place for me
         on the land of Mara...
Shelia:  Then why dont you join us? Such an experienced warrior like you would
         be a great help to us! If you stay with us, I am sure that Grey will
         not dare to touch you.
Dino:    Miss... how do you know all these things? I...
Shelia:  Dont ask me how! Just join us, will you?
Thor:    Hum! Play mysteries with us... you are one strange lady.
Shelia:  Hey! I am helping you strengthen your team!
Thor:    Whatever...
Dino:    All right then! I will join you! My name is Dino. Nice to meet you.
Alex:    Welcome, Dino. We had better get out of here. We will talk after
         finding some place to rest.
Harold:  Agree!

---Go Extreme---

This level is definitely not a good place to go extreme. It does not matter how
hard you level up in the first 2 chapters. You will be desperate saving Dino
and watching out the big Capital in this chapter. Just passing the chapter
alone is good enough. If you wish to get the best result, dont let Dino kill
anybody, dont use Yoni's magic one-hit KO any soldiers, or use Alex's high
damage one-hit KO any soldiers.

---New Character Analyse---

Dino
You will still pass this chapter even if Dino is killed. But then you will not
get this character. And believe me! You want this character! Correct, he is
weak. In fact he is even weaker than Thor. But if you want the VERY powerful
special skill Flaming Blade, you will level him up, and upgrade him into a
Sword Master. And you will be rewarded.

Shelia: Says who? There are not many people know about this shortcut. Only...
Harold: Hey, there are some people ahead.

Large group of bandit waits ahead.

Bandit: You are all going to Sara Village? What business do you have there?
Thor:   None of your business! Get out of way!
Bandit: Hum! Just like Boss said, someone is coming to raid from the shortcut.
Alex:   Raid? What are you talking about?
Bandit: Dont play dump with me. Die!

--- Strategy---

This is the first challenging chapter since you dont much chance to crazy
levelling before this. For the first time, the enemy has Necromancers and Dark
Priests on their side. The Dark Priests are frustrating since they can fully
heal a near dead enemy, and the Necromancers can use burning fire! Even the
bandit minions are upgraded with improved damage, defence and HP. This is not
easy at all. The formation of your group is very important. Stay away from the
range of the burning fire. If you have to take a hit from that spell, make sure
that character will not take any other hit in that round. The good thing is
that the Necromancers and the Dark Priests do not have much MP. So their MP
will quickly run out. There are not many specific tips I can give you. I
suggest use Thor, Yoni and Gaia to hold the enemy on the left, use Harold and
Shelia to defend the right side. Alex will go where he is needed since he has
high mobility. If you rescued Dino in last chapter it will pay off right now.
Even Dino has low damage and defence; he still can at least feed someone
Medicines when things go bad. Also remember, you must push forward unless you
want to get your butt busted. Three rounds later:

---Dialogue---

One orc warrior appears from each corner.

Orc One:   Grr... Why is it so noisy here...?
Orc Two:   Grr... The humans are fighting...
Orc Three: This looks fun. We will attack the one with less people.
Orc Four:  Agree! Agree!

--- Strategy---

Frigging back-stabbing orcs... They have high mobility, but if you push forward
hard enough they may not be able to attack you right away. In either case you
must do what it takes to kill at least one orc in the follow round. It should
not be so hard. Because once you kill one of them:

---Dialogue---

Orc One: Wooooo... This is not fun... We are not playing anymore.

All orcs will repeat in the following round.

--- Strategy---

The rest is simple after taking care of the orcs. Lure the Necromancers near
your group. One Burning Fire from Yoni or Shelia's arrow can make a 1-hit KO.
And the rest should be fine.

---Dialogue---

Thor:   What is with this land of Mara? There are bandits anywhere.
Shelia: No... Something is not right; something is going on in Sara Village.
        Hurry everybody.
Harold: We need a bit rest right now. If something is going on in the village,
        we must be prepared.
Shelia: It is all right. There is a small Inn on the way. Come on.

---Go Extreme---

It begins! This is the first chapter where you can go nuts with levelling
although it is a bit challenging. To get things started, kill all the bandits
and leave the 2 Dark Priests, of course it is even better if you can make one
of the Necromancers use up all his MP and keep him alive.
Since they are spell casters with low damage. They will not attack you as long
as your defence is higher than their damage. You can go ahead and cut them to
get experience but dont kill them. And since there is nothing for them to do,
they will just rest. Each time they rest, their HP will re-generate by about
20%. So cut them and get the experience again after their HP is full. Repeat
these steps, and you will gain some levels that you are not suppose to gain at
this point of the game. Since Thor, Yoni, and Dino have low damage, you can get
quite some levels for them. It will definitely help if you go extreme right
now. You are looking at the biggest battle so far in the next chapter.

---Dialogue---

Huge groups of bandits are in town. A woman with eyeband seems to be in charge.

Woman: Ha! Sara Village will be ours as long as we take care of the soldiers.

Outside the church, there is a small group of soldiers.

Soldier: Stop your day dreaming, woman! Our reinforcement will arrive soon.
         Then we will see about it!
Woman:   That depends on if you can live long enough to see it!

A young female priest steps outside from the church.

Priest: Cursed bandits! How dare you touch this sacred village?! You will pay
        for this!
Woman:  And what do you intent to do, little girl? I suggest you go back to
        that church if you dont want to get hurt.
Priest: Dont underestimate me. My guards will arrive soon, and...

Thor and others enter Sara Village.

Shelia: Ah! Just like we thought! What is going on here?
Harold: Man... Look at their numbers... We got quite some work to do.
Woman:  Ha! These are your guards? This group of little kids is the
        reinforcement?
Priest: This...
Thor:   Hey! Who is little kid! Watch your tongue! Old woman!
Woman:  Foolish kids. You will know what pain is after tasting it. Slay them
        all!
Priest: Hey there. Can you guys come and help? Take out these bandits. I will
        pay you.
Thor:   Whatever... But kicking butts sound fun. Come on Alex!
Yoni:   There are many of them. Be careful.

--- Strategy---

Needless to say, everybody run up! In two rounds half of the soldiers will
die. The name of the priest is Marlene and she has super low mobility. Get her
into a good position for healing. The enemies are stronger than last chapter.
Beware the Burning Fire magic. Once you do some work:

---Dialogue---

Woman:  It takes so much to beat up some kids? All right, second squad, third
        squad, move out!

One round after, 6 knights appear from the north.

Knight: How dare you bandits! How dare you set your dirty feet inside the
        sacred Sara Village! If you do not fear God's wrath, us loyal knights
        of Arks will teach you the lesson!
Woman:  You came right on times. I was worrying who would clean up all the
        corpses of these soldiers... Ha...
Knight: Curse you! Come on everyone! Show them what we got!

--- Strategy---

6 knights are great help. They have high damage, decent defense, and high
mobility. But on the other hand, they can grab all your experience away. So
hack up with these knights, use them as meat shields to finish off enemies.
Also you should send one character to the left to pick up the 2 treasures.
Few rounds later:

---Dialogue---

One orc appear from each corner.

Orc One:   Grrr... So noisy...
Orc Two:   Grrr... What's going on...
Orc Three: The humans are fighting...
Orc Four:  Great! Let's attack the ones with less people.

One round after.

Orc One: Hey wait a second! Those are the people we ran into last time!
Orc Two: Oh crap! Run!

--- Strategy---

Well, the orcs are just stupid... There shouldn't be much challenge as long as
knights teamed up with you. The woman will run up to you now. She can kill
Marlene in 1 hit since she has Poison Falchion so be careful. As the same time
you are fighting them, send Alex to the bottom right corner to pick up the
treasures. Soon you will defeat that bandit woman:

---Dialogue---

Woman:   Ah... I am beaten by a bunch of kids... I can't...
Bandits: Oh no! Our boss is defeated. Run!

--- Strategy---

All of the remaining bandits will start retreating. Kill them before they
escape. Congratulations! You are now done with bandits/pirates forever.

---Dialogue---

Marlene: Thanks for your help. I would like to give you all my sincere
         gratitude representing all the priests and people from Town of Sara.
         Beside the promised commission, is there anything else you need of us?
         We will be glad to help.
Thor:    You can keep your money. Just help Yoni get her memory back. That's
         all we need.
Marlene: She lost her memory...? I'm afraid the priests here cannot help her.
Thor:    Why?
Marlene: I have learned the basic Holy magic from the priests in this town. As
         far as I know, Holy magic can cure physical disease or injuries. Loss
         of memory is caused by mental events. Since Holy magic cannot affect
         one's mental status there is nothing we can do.
Thor:    Oh... that means we came here for nothing... Shelia...!
Shelia:  Sorry! But... this isn't entirely my fault. I really thought the
         priests here can cure Yoni.
Alex:    Thor. There is no point blaming Shelia. Maybe it's best for us to
         decide what to do next.
Yoni:    Thor, thanks for your help. But maybe I...
Marlene: Don't worry. I believe I know another way that may be a cure for Yoni.
         Want to try?
Thor:    Is there a condition?
Marlene: Don't make it sound like a deal. Here is the thing. There is a Saint
         named Jonah in Dock of Prussia at south. He is a very wise man. He
         will be able to find a way to help Yoni get her memory back.
Alex:    So you want to...?
Marlene: Yup! I am looking for Jonah as well. But right now this area is not
         very safe. So I need to go with you people. I wouldn't like much
         trouble. I will bring my own servants and guards.
Alex:    Is that all right...?
Harold:  It is about Yoni's memory. We should try everything.
Thor:    I agree. Then let's go meet Jonah. By the way Shelia, What do you
         intent to do now?
Shelia:  I will just follow you guys. You must admit at least I help a little.
         Beside I would be able to see many interesting things travelling with
         you people.
Thor:    Weird girl... all right then. Let's go.

---Go Extreme---

Yup! You can go extreme again in this chapter. The condition is: all knights
must die because they would kill the Necromancers and Dark Priests you left
alive. Well... it's up to you to choose what to do. If you don't support the
knights, they will all be killed for sure. Once the bandit woman fall all
bandits will start running. So lure them deep and kill the woman. Then use the
high mobility of Alex to quickly block their way of escaping and eventually
use the whole team to surround them. By the way, since they are running away
they will not attack you even a weak character like Marlene stands in front of
them. Of course they will still counter attack if you hit them.
Basically once you get to this point, you can start the levelling procedure
again. Hit but not kill, wait for HP regeneration, hit again, and so on... I
left a Necromancer and a Dark Priest alive, and I get Thor to level 12, Yoni to
level 14, Alex to level 11, Gaia to level 10, Harold to level 11, Shelia to
level 11, and Marlene to level 13.

---New Character Analyse---

Marlene
Finally! The healer has arrived! She is your first and best healer. She is the
only character gain Teleport magic before changing class. She is a major help
at beginning of the game. After changing class to High Priest she can learn two
amazing healing magic Rejuvenation and God's Favour. Of course she can't learn
the best healing magic, because only Yoni as Summoner can have it. If she
changes class to Saint, she will have an addition spell: Holy Bolt. It's the
only aggressive magic healers can learn and it's powerful.
To change into a Saint, Ring of Saint is needed. It can be found in Chapter 7.

Thor and others enter the dock with 4 mercenaries of Marlene.

Marlene: Strange... it seems Jonah is out of town. Maybe we can take a look
         here...
Alex:    There are some soldiers patrolling. Be careful guys.
Soldier: (Notice Thor and others) Hey! Stop right there! This is a restricted
         area! What is your business here?
Harold:  I'm sorry. We are here to look for...
Soldier: You aren't looking for anybody. Get out of here! Wait... All of you!
         freeze!
Thor:    What is it now?
Soldier: (To one of the mercenary) I believe your name is Eddie. You and some
         other bandits have robbed a small village 2 months ago. We have been
         looking for you. So you are someone's mercenary now.
Eddie:   ...
Soldier: Hum! I think it's the best for you to unarm yourself and go with us.
         It's for your best.
Marlene: Wait a second. My father has given me these mercenaries. If you take
         him away how can I get back to my father?
Soldier: That is none of my concern. If you keep interrupting we will arrest
         you as well.
Marlene: (With attitude) really!?
Capital: (Notice the argument) hey! What's the problem over there?
Soldier: Capital. We have found a suspect in those people. But they refuse to
         let us take that guy away.
Capital: Then capture them all. Kill the anyone who resistances.
Alex:    We are in trouble again. What now Thor?
Thor:    These soldiers are too unreasonable! Let's teach them a lesson.
Shelia:  Well it seems we have to anyway.

---Strategy---

Now we are fighting soldiers. I suggest letting 4 mercenaries get killed at the
beginning since they only make things messier. The first group is really easy.
Just watch out for the Necromancers a bit, they have Lighting spell now, it's
weaker than Burning Fire, but attack more than one character. Also the enemy's
archer can be a threat to Shelia, Yoni, or Marlene. But if you went Extreme in
the last chapter you can just tear through them like cheese cutting. As you
kick the butts of those soldiers:

---Dialogue---

Capital: You all fight strong! You are not normal people. Who are you all?
Thor:    Just told you. We are some travellers. That's all.
Capital: No! You can't be just some travellers.
Thor:    Up to you to believe or not¡­

---Strategy---

The capital is smart enough to know Thor isn't just some traveller, but not
smart enough to understand fighting with Thor is the worst idea. Lure the
capital out by placing a character within 5 blocks of him and stay out of the</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
range of Necromancer's magic. One round is enough to take him out:

---Dialogue---

Capital: You aren't normal bandits¡­ Who are you? What is your purpose here?
Thor:    This whole thing is just a big misunderstanding. We are...

A soldier appear from the south.

Soldier: Capital! What is going on here?
Capital: Go! Tell the knight squad to watch out these bandits. I have done what
         I can...
Soldier: Yes sir! I will do this for you!

After all enemies are defeated, an elf archer enters.

Archer:  Oh my god! You guys attacked the soldiers of Arks nation. And you even
         killed the capital. You will be wanted in the whole country!
Shelia:  This whole thing is a misunderstanding. But they just wouldn't listen
         to us...
Archer:  Ai... what's done is done... so really, what are you all doing here?
Marlene: We are here to see Saint Jonah...
Archer:  Jonah? He left 2 days ago.
Marlene: Why? I heard he have stayed here for years.
Archer:  That's right. But strange thing kept happening around here. There are
         often people killed or simply disappeared. Even the national knight
         division starts paying attention. Do you guys know about it?
Alex:    No wonder there are soldiers everywhere.
Archer:  My name is Baker. I am a friend of Jonah. Few days ago he came and
         told me that he discovered a dark scheme. And he believes it's related
         to the incidents happening around here. He left me some information
         then went away to find out more about it.
Thor:    Ah... came here for nothing again. And we made some problems with the
         national force...
Marlene: Are you blaming me? But this isn't my fault!
Thor:    What are you talking about? If it isn't the mercenaries your father
         gave you...
Baker:   All right, all right. There is no time for you guys to play the the
         blaming game. How about this? Jonah asked me to meet him in Arks
         Palace 2 days later. Why don't you all come with me if you need to
         see Jonah?
Harold:  Arks Palace? Is that safe since we made all these troubles?
Shelia:  You don't need to worry about this. I can guarantee there won't be any
         problems.
Alex:    Shelia? How can you be so sure?
Shelia:  Secret!
Thor:    OK. Let's get prepared to take off. Mr. Baker how about you?
Baker:   Sure. Go back to the city with me to get ready. We will leave soon.

---Go Extreme---

This chapter is almost made for Go Extreme. After taking out the Capital move
your character into the range of Necromancer's magic. As your characters are
being fried, let Marlene cure them. She will level up fast. After both
Necromancers ran out of MP, kill the normal soldiers and leave the Necromancers
and Dark Priests for cut and heal. In fact, if your team is good enough, you
may even leave the 2 archers alive if all your character have defense above 70
(my team does). I left 2 Archers, 2 Necromancers, 2 Dark Priest. I didn't go
all the way 255 rounds. But by the end all my characters are out of the line.
Yoni is level 22 and has the Dragon Fire magic.

---New Character Analyse---

Baker
He is your second archer in the team. He can be around the same level comparing
to Shelia. Level he up regular and he can be quite some help. You should
upgrade him into Marksman class as you should for Shelia.
Both Baker and Shelia need Book of Eye and Heart to become Marksman. You can
find three of them in the entire game. So you don't have to worry about it.

***Special Note***

This chapter has the biggest challenge in the whole game. Before 15th round you
must kill the capital. Or else the Reed, a character suppose to appear in
chapter 9, will show up now with 8 Loyal Elite Knights!!! They are at higher
level than the level you suppose be, and they are equipped with Spear of
Vanguard or Giant Yataghan!!! They can pretty much give a one-hit KO to any of
your characters.

At round 10.

Capital: Damn it... these people are strong... everyone hold your ground. Sir
         Reed will arrive soon!
Thor:    Sounds like they are waiting for their reinforcement. Hey guys, take
         out that capital guy first!

At round 15, Reed and 8 knights enter.

Reed:    Capital, what is going on here?
Capital: Sir! These people are refused to let us arrest suspect. They are
         strong fighters too. We are trying to take them down.
Reed:    Oh... they are just some bandits. Capture them!

There is a way to defeat them with Go Extreme. You must be a devoted Go Extreme
player. If your team is at the same level as my team like I described in GO
Extreme section from previous chapter, then you could have a chance. While you
fight the first wave, kill everything but leave 2 archers alive. You must
manage to get your whole team on the north of the archers and make sure they
are struck in the narrow alleyway. Engage with Reed in the alleyway. Reed and
his knights are like Alex, they can attack 2 blocks away. So you can weaken
this advantage by having 2 archers in front of you. They can't attack their
own archers, so there are maximal 4 knights can attack in one round. Your
character should be able to take at least one hit. Have Marlene ready to heal
for every round with Recovery magic. Have Yoni using Violent Fire every round.
I suggest Thor with Poison Falchion (high damage) in the middle, Harold with
Whirly Axe (ranged attack) and Alex with Long Halberd (ranged attack) on 2
sides. Have Yoni behind Thor to attract one knight's attack for each round. At
last, prepare at least 2 magic potions on Shelia, Gaia, or Dino and use them on
Yoni or Marlene when needed. It will be tough, but it will be a great
accomplishment if you manage to take them down. After that go finish off the
capital and other craps.

If you can't do it, then just kill the capital before round 15. This part is
only made for some of the crazy players. Don't kill yourself for it.

***Extra Note:
There are some HARDCORE players who manage to get Yoni to level 20+ with Dragon
Fire before this chapter. They crushed these Elite Knights like worms... I have
to say: VERY impressive.

Saint.

---Dialogue---

Thor and others enter

Baker:  ... this is the main road to the palace. It's the fastest way. But we
        have a big chance of running into the national force.
Harold: Yup. In fact I already saw them

Large group of national force appears

Knight: That's them! They are the people who murdered the capital in Prussia!
        Take them out!
Shelia: Wait, we are all on the same side here. It was just a big
        misunderstanding...
Knight: Don't play any trick with me! Prepare to die!
Shelia: Ai... can't they just be reasonable for one minute...? Guess we have
        no choice. You're ready Thor?
Thor:   Sure I'm cool. You are the one should be careful. Don't overdo.
Shelia: Thanks Thor...

---Strategy---

Well, typical chapter. Just kill everything then you will win. Have everyone
run up and engage with their first wave. The Necromancer's spells are still
the same and they shouldn't give you any serious threat anymore. But you need
to get the attention of second's wave by pushing above line (x, 11). Because
only if you do that, at 11th round:

---Dialogue---

A blond girl enters from the east, chased by group of soldiers

Girl:   Geez... So many guys are chasing one little girl. Don't you all feel
        ashamed?
Knight: You made one of my men lie on bed for 3 months with one punch! You
        attacked officer in national force! You are coming with me to make
        things right!
Girl:   You should ask him why he had to look at me like a rascal. Are all the
        officers in national force like that?
Knight: Hum! I have no time to chat with you. Get her!
Harold: Hey, many soldiers are attacking a girl over there. What's going on?
Baker:  Man, we have trouble handling ourselves. Stay focus here...
Thor:   How? We should watch those soldiers bullying a little girl? I am going
        help her!
Alex:   Ok, I am going too. It makes no difference just to add these bad-eggs
        to our list.

---Strategy---

Now it becomes a rescue mission. But note that she is much stronger and
independent than Dino in Chapter 3. The soldier cannot damage her much, the
threat is the knight. Before 11th round get couple strong character there to
support her. Meanwhile engage with the second wave. This is a bit challenging
since you have to split your team to handle 2 things. But if you are a Go
Extreme this is a piece of cake. The real concern is the Knight Leader. After
taking him out everything will be done:

---Dialogue---

Knight Leader: Your Majesty... I can't server you any longer... Forgive me
               please...
Shelia:        You are mistaken! We are not here to harm the king!
Knight Leader: Really? Then who are the people that... ah...

As all enemies are defeated, everyone gathers around the girl.

Girl:   My name is Carrie. Thanks for your help. Even the Nation Knight Squad
        is no match of you. Where are you guys from?
Thor:   It's pretty complicated to explain, and it's quite dangerous here. I
        think you should go back home and have some sleep.
Carrie: Ah! How dare you downgrade me?! I may be just a girl, but my master
        is...
Baker:  Yes Miss Carrie. Your mastery in martial art is very impressive. Who
        is your master?
Carrie: Hmm... I can't tell you yet. But if you let me join your group, I will
        give a little clue.
Baker:  Of course! Since we have trouble with National Force right now, decent
        fighter like you will be a great help to us.
Carrie: All right! Nice to meet you, everyone.
Alex:   This isn't the place to talk. Miss Carrie, let's be on our way.

---Go Extreme---

This is another Go Extreme chapter. Remember you can only keep the enemies
alive if at least one of your characters have higher defense than their damage.
At this point you will be able to see how hard you levelled up. If your team is
just average then you can keep the Dark Priest or the Necromancers alive. On
the other hand if your team are quite decent levelled you will be able to leave
some Archers as well. As for my team, Thor, Alex, Dino, and Gaia have higher
defense than Knights' damage. So I left 2 knights alive and also 2 Archers and
3 Dark Priests for other characters. By the end of the chapter, all my
characters are levelled to around 25.

---New Character Analyse---

Carrie
It's the best that you rescue her. She is a very good fighter and worth
levelling. With proper levelling she has high damage, high defense, and high
evasion rate. It's the best for you to upgrade her into a Kong-Fu Lord instead
of Kong-Fu Fighter.
To be upgraded into Kong-Fu Lord, Carrie needs Book of Apperception.

Baker:  Look! Palace is right here.
Alex:   But there wasn't a single enemy on the way. Could it be...
Harold: Yup. They are all waiting for us right here.

Larges group of soldiers are gathered in front of palace.

Knight: Damned bandits! Doesn't matter how strong you are. This is where you
        will meet your doom.
Shelia: Wait! Everybody listen! Stop this meaningless battle. We are all on the
        same side...
Knight: And how do you expect me to believe you? Do you think I am an idiot?
Shelia: Ungraceful servant! All right, look what this is.
Knight: Uh... This... this is the Tear of Goddess! The jewelry that is always
        possessed by the queen or princess! That means...
Shelia: That's right! I am Shelia, the princess of Arks Nation. I command you
        all to unarm yourselves right away.
Knight: But... princess... you and your friends attacked the Investigate Squad
        and killed the capital. Why would you...?
Shelia: There was a little misunderstanding. They are way too unreasonable.
        They don't even give me a chance to explain. We had to take care of
        them.

A woman, appears to be a knight speaks.

Woman:  Capital! This is our princess without any doubts. We should welcome her
        back in the palace and discuss about what happened later...
Knight: No way! His highness has commanded me to slay these people. I will be
        disobeying his order if I don't do what he asked!
Woman:  But...
Knight: That's enough! Death to all who oppose his highness! Attack!

The woman walks away from her group.

Woman:  Worry not! Princess! As a loyal knight in Scardi family I will defend
        you with my life!
Knight: Lorna! How dare you?! Then you should die with them!

---Strategy---

This chapter may be a bit hard for normal players. But for leveling nuts like
me, all the enemies are made of butter. From 3rd to 7th round there will be two
knights appear every round. just get your group into good formation. 2 of the
enemy Necromancers have new spell: Sky Lighting. That spell hurts even for Go
Extreme character, so be a bit careful. Also there are a new kind of enemies:
Heavy Armed Warrior. They have high damage, don't let them go anywhere near
any spell-casters. You have these two new characters Carrie and Lorna. Let them
do the finishing blow to level them up faster. After the knight waves are over,
all the enemy will begin to push forward. Kill their leader:

---Dialogue---

Knight: Princess Shelia... I was just obeying my order. Please forgive... Ah...

---Strategy---

There is nothing to worry about anymore. Just hack up and slash everything.
After you finish your job:

---Dialogue---

Everyone include Lorna gather in front of the palace

Shelia: Ai... how did things get so off hand? I must talk to my father. I must
        Clarify this whole thing.
Lorna:  Princess Shelia, it's chaos inside the palace. Please allow me to
        lead to way. I will guarantee your safety.
Shelia: You mentioned that you are in Scardi family. Is that the family of the
        Knights you were talking about?
Lorna:  That's right! Our families are made of knights who guard the blood of
        the King. Although I am the only one left in the family, I will fulfill
        my duty.
Shelia: I understand. Then come with us... Thor, Alex, I will need your help
        from now. Everyone let's go into the palace.
        (Shelia and Lorna enter the palace)
Thor:   Shelia is the princess...? Then who is Yoni?
Alex:   Simple... We got it wrong. What do you think we should do now?
Thor:   We will help Shelia. Come on!

---Go Extreme---

The perfect Go Extreme chapter. I think everyone knows what to do by now. By
the end of this chapter I got Carrie and Lorna levelled to 25. And others are
around 25 to 30. Yoni is levelled to 36, Marlene is levelled to 38.

---Attention---
At this point you can take it easy. You CAN upgrade a character's class as long
he/she reaches level 20, but there isn't a option for Go Extreme player beside
level 40. If you want Carrie to become the powerful Kong-Fu Lord, the Book of
Apperception can't be found until chapter 16. If you want Thor to become Hero,
the Badge of Bravery will not be found until chapter 13. If you want Yoni to be
the legendary Summoner, the Covenant of Fairy can be found in chapter 15. And
if you want to both Shelia and Baker to become Marksman, the second Book of Eye
and Heart will be found in chapter 13.
So there is no point to push so hard. But for character like Marlene, Alex, and
Harold, you can go ahead to level them up like crazy men. But no point try so
hard on Thor, Yoni, and etc...

---New Character Analyse---

Lorna
Woohoo! Second knight, and of course, the second Alex. Lorna is a very decent
character if you level her up well. Just for the high mobility along, you shall
use this character. Later on you can choose bewteen Dragon Knight or Paladin
Knight. For either option she will be a reliable character at the later part of
the game.
Dragon Egg is needed for Lorna to become a Dragon Knight. It can be found in
many places throughout the chapters.

Thor and others enter the courtyard in the palace

Thor:   Hmm, Shelia... Your father has quite an army prepared for us...
Shelia: Let me handle it.

Reed, the Capital of Loyal Elite Knights is leading large group of Warriors,
Knights, Necromancers, and Dark Priests.

Reed:   Princess Shelia, how can you take the side of these bandits. His
        Highness has commanded to capture these people. I will welcome you back
        into the palace, just leave these bandits to the Loyal Knights.
Shelia: Reed, I always thinks you are smart. Can't you even trust me? Withdraw
        these soldiers, I must talk to my father and make things right.
Reed:   Princess Shelia, His Highness gave us the order that we should capture
        the bandits first before doing anything else. If you insist protecting
        them, then... please forgive me!
Shelia: You are going to attack me, Reed?
Reed:   Princess Shelia, please forgive my disrespect.
        (To others) Capture them!

---Strategy---

There are a lot of enemies. But they won't attack unless you go into specific
area. So just push forward step by step. As for Go Extreme players... forget
about what I just said and go nuts with your character. The Necromancers have
Violent Fire now, so watch out a bit for that. Reed is quite powerful, unless
you have done some crazy levelling don't let Reed and 2 other knights attack
one of your character together. Lure them out and beat them down:

---Dialogue---

Reed:   Oh... Princess... Why do you join them to harm his highness...?
Shelia: Reed! Why would I want to hurt my father? Tell me what's going on here!
Reed:   There were assassins broke in King's bedroom few days ago. Thank God
        the guards heard to sound and chase them away...
Shelia: Really? Then what happened?!
Reed:   The assassins left the message saying that they will come again. After
        such affright his Highness was resting on bed for the last few days...
Thor:   But What does it have to do with us?
Reed:   After all these we sent out investigating teams to search for clues. We
        found many strange things. Such as the incidents of people disappearing
        around the dock... And you people attacked the investigating team...
Shelia: So everyone in the palace believes that I am the assassin!? That is too
        ridiculous!
Reed:   Minister Grey strongly agree to this... And he commanded us to capture
        you all...
Shelia: Wait a second. How come Grey is in charge of everything?
Reed:   His Highness was resting lately. So Minister Grey has been handling
        everything...

A group of Knights appears.

Knight: How dare you, Reed! You have joined the bandits as well. Minister Grey
        commanded us to arrest you right away!
Reed:   Damn it! I understand now! It's Grey himself behind this all along!
        That traitor!!
Shelia: Reed! That means my father is in great danger! We have to fight our way
        inside!
Reed:   Princess Shelia! I didn't fulfill my duty as a Loyal Knight. Let me go
        with you!
Shelia: You are wounded badly...
Thor:   Don't worry Shelia. I think this guy is quite tough. We need all the
        help right now. Just let Marlene cast some Holy Magic, he will be good
        to go.
Shelia: Thor...
Reed:   Yes Princess Shelia! Give me a chance to make up for my mistake!
Thor:   All right!
Shelia: Ok. Allow me to borrow the strength of you guys. Let's go!

---Strategy---

The knight group can be challenging, don't give them to chance to touch your
archers or spell-caster. Meanwhile groups of Heavy Armed Warriors will show up
as well. Take your time to do the work:

---Dialogue---

A soldier runs in

Soldier: Stop! Everyone! Minister Grey is killed!
Reed:    Hold on a second! What happened?
Soldier: I was patroling as usual. There was a scream when I walked by Minister
         Grey's room. I went into his room and saw him lying in his own blood.
Reed:    How did this happen!? Princess Shelia, this palace seems dangerous, I
         will send out my scouts to find out what's going on. I will get back
         to you right away.
Shelia:  Ok! Be careful!

---Go Extreme---

I did Go Extreme at the chapter. I didn't keep any enemy spell-casters alive,
not even archers. I keep 6 Heavy Armed Warriors since my team is at very high
level. These warriors can take quite some hit for Go Extreme. I had Marlene and
Shelia at level 40 and ready to upgrade. And everyone in the team is above 30.

---Dialogue---

Thor and others enter a cave.

Thor:   Whoa! This is quite a huge cave.
Alex:   Without some help we wouldn't be able to find this cave behind the fall
        ...
Reed:   Princess Shelia, we have made things clear. Grey has planned the whole
        thing with the enemy. He wished to be the king himself. In fact, his
        highness was already taken away in that night. Grey pretended our king
        was in the bedroom afterward, and gave orders all by himself.
Shelia: And he wanted to use the opporunity of me attacking the solders. He
        wanted to have me killed so there would be no obstruction for him.
Reed:   Forgive me for being a fool. Luckly we found a soldier used to send
        messages to this cave, so we know where to look. His highness should be
        here.
Thor:   Then what are you waiting for? Let's drag the guy who is behind this
        out and give him some serious beating! So we will be done with this
        whole thing.

In the deepest of cave, a Giant seems like made of rock

Rock Demon: Foolish mortals! You are all so ignorant.
Reed:       So you are the one behind the curtain! Give us our king! Or Loyal
            Elite Kights will not let you get away!
Rock Demon: You are talking about that Old guy over there? Don't worry. After
            sending you all to hell, I will gladly deliver him as well. Hahaha!
Alex:       Hum! Ugly looking guy with big words... Show us what you got first!
Reed:       The enemy has quite lots of troops. Take care everyone! our
            reinforcement will arrive soon.
Rock Demon: Come then you mortals! None of you will leave here alive! Hahaha...

---Strategy---

All the enemis have became much more powerful than before. Dark Warrior, Dark
Archers... Try to push forward as fast as you can. At round 5:

---Dialogue---

A group of knights enters.

Kights: Capital Reed! Forgive us for being late!
Reed:   Don't worry! Our king is held here. By the glory of Loyal Knights, We
        will fight with our lives to ensure the safety of his highness!
Kights: Roger!

---Strategy---

Keep advancing with the help of knights. RockDemon will command his warrior to
kill Sophia and the King if you are too slow. The RockDemon has Rock Breaking
magic, large area magic, so be careful. After you take him down:

---Dialogue---

Rock Demon: Uh... How could this be...? I am defeated by mortals... Master!
            Save me...
Alex:       It's too late begging for mery! Now tell us! Why did you kidnap the
            King! What is your Purpose for all these?
Rock Demon: The Golden Badge... That is... the key to...
Thor:       The key to what?
Rock Demon: The key... to sky... ah...

All enemies are defeated, everyone gathers at the entry of cave.

Shelia: Are you all right, father? I was so worried!
King:   I'm fine, darling. Thanks to your friend. I won't be able to make it
        without their help.
Baker:  Your highness. May I ask why they kidnap you? What do they want from
        you?
King:   Simple. They want the ancient artifacts: the Golden Badge.
Thor:   Golden Badge? What is that?
Sophia: I can answer this question for you. Golden Badge is the ancestral
        artifacts of the Arks Royal family. Legend says it contains unknown
        power so every king has held it carefully. But everyone ever knew what
        its actual use is.
King:   They captured me here and ask me of that artifacts. I could not sustain
        the torture, so I told them where the artifacts is. So they kidnap
        Sophia here as well...
Baker:  So that's why! This is exactly what Jonah suspected!
Sophia: Saint Jonah? You know him?
Baker:  I am a good friend of his. The reason I am here is he asked me to meet
        him at Arks Palace.
Sophia: He was here few days ago. He told me there will be a friend of his come
        to the palace. He asked me to lend the Golden Badge to him, I guess you
        are the one he meant.
Baker:  So you met Jonah... Can I borrow the Golden Badge then?
Sophia: This is really up to his highness...
King:   Not a problem! I heard of the Saint Jonah long ago. He must have the
        need of Golden Badge. Sophia, give the Golden Badge to them as soon as
        we return to the palace.
Sophia: Your highness. Can I ask a thing of you...?
King:   What is it?
Sophia: Just like Jonah mentioned, there is a evil force up to something on
        this peaceful land. Jonah himself has gone to find more information
        about it. As a priest I wish I can go and do my part. I will use my
        faith in God and power of Holy to help them stop the evil. May I have
        your permission of leaving the temple?
King:   I see... All right Sophia. Go with them, take care of yourself.
Sophia: Thanks, your highness. May the Holy Spirit be with you.
Shelia: Father, I have a thing to ask as well...
King:   Shelia... are you...
Shelia: Yes father. I have been travelling with them for these days, and I feel
        I have grown up so much. Right now evil is threatening this nation. As
        the princess, I want to go and help to stop this evil.
King:   Shelia... you look tired... have you been resting well?
Shelia: Everything is great father. Everyone is so good to me. Durin battles
        Thor and Alex will always protect me.
King:   Thor, Alex... Thanks for taking care of Shelia. If there is time I
        would like to talk with you.
Alex:   Thanks, your highness.
Thor:   Yeah, we never thought Shelia would be the princess...
King:   Hahaha... Shelia, you are still good at keeping secret. All right, you
        can go with Thor and Alex. But to ensure your safety, Reed will go with
        you as well.
Shelia: Yes! Yes! Thanks, father!
Reed:   Worry not, my king. I will protect princess with all my might.
King:   All right then. Let's leave this cave.
Reed:   The loyal knights have prepare to welcome you back. Let's go!
Alex:   (To Thor)Hehe, things are getting bigger and bigger. So what do you
        think, Thor?
Thor:   Whatever happens, we will find Jonah and let him cure Yoni. What do you
        say, Alex?
Alex:   Of course. Let's go.

---Go Extreme---

It's hard to Go Extreme in this chapter, but still possible. First, your team
must be already well levelled; second, you must be able to push over the first
hole before the knights show up. You need to kill RockDemon fast, while keep
some units alive. But here is the problem: the knights will try to kill the
enemies; there are Necromancers cast annoying magic like Poison and Paralyze;
the only enemies you can left alive are Dark Priest, Dark Archer, and maybe
Dark Warrior, but these enemies are on the way of killing RockDemon. So if you
want to Go Extreme in this chapter, it's best that you have Marlene as Saint
with Teleport Magic. With this magic, I killed Rock Demon in 3 rounds. In that
case, the knights will push much slower and only a portion of them will attack.
I just withdraw a bit and watch them die. (Please forgive me...) And the rest
is easy. Kill all Necromancers, leave other kinds alive... By the end of this
chapter, I got most characters above level 35. Dino is level 40 and read to
change class.

On the other hand, this is the chapter where Go Extreme pays off. It's great
watching your team tears through all these powerful enemies.

***Extra Note:
DONT try to level up Reed! DONT give him any good items! He will join you at
the end of the chapter as a level 18 character despite what level he is at the
end of the chapter.

---New Character Analyse---

Reed
The last character join the team as a pre-upgraded knight. His characteristics
are very similar to Alex and Lorna: high mobility, high damage, high defense...
Again, choose bewteen Dragon Knight and Paladin Knight for higher magic defense
or higher mobility when upgrading him.
Reed needs Dragon Egg to become a Dragon Knight.

Sophia
Second healer joins the team! She is another version of Marlene, and I suggest
to upgrade her into Saint after reaching level 40. There is a reason why you
MUST use this character. Sophia will learn Vigor Magic reaching level 40
BEFORE upgrading. In the entire game, Sophia and only Sophia has this powerful
magic. Since Vigor can make actioned character available for action again...
imagine Thor as Hero attacks twice in one round, or even better, Yoni casts
Seraph the Wrath twice in one round...
To become a Saint, Sophia needs to have Ring of Saint.

---Dialogue---

Thor and others enter the forest.

Baker:  Sophia, are you sure Jonah is heading toward this direction?
Sophia: He said he will travel north, make way through Plain of Ice, and toward
        the Dark Forest. We are on the correct path right now...
Harold: Hmm... I don't really know why, but something isn't right about this
        place. We may have gone to the wrong place.
Sophia: Yeah... this place seems a bit strange to me as well... Maybe we should
        not have taken the shortcut...
Lorna:  Be on your guard! There are some creatures here...

Large group of orcs is nearby.

Orc 1:      Grr... I see human! What do we do?
Orc 2:      Hoo... We should be the only one knows about the treasures here!
Orc 3:      Doesn't matter! Whoever in our way will die!
Orc Leader: Yes! Kill them first!

Baker:  Ah geez... these orcs are both stupid and ruthless. Prepare for battle!
Alex:   But what are the treasures they mentioned?
Baker:  Don't know... This place is near the Elf Forest... But I was never here
        before...
        (An elf girl enters, sees Baker)
Girl:   Hey! Aren't you Baker? What are you doing here?
Baker:  Oh! Shan! It's you! I heard you went away studying magic. What are you
        doing here?
Shan:   This place is where elf elders hide treasures for thousands of years.
        We used to call this place "The Forest of Mist"...
Baker:  I remember. This forest always has mist covering itself. We were told
        not to come here when we were little... So what's going on here?
Shan:   There were some strange things happened around here. The protecting
        aura for this forest has disappeared for some reason. These orcs heard
        about the treasures and wishs to take them.
Baker:  Really?

Orc Leader: (to Shan) So you took them here! Slay them all!

Shan:   Baker! We have to protect these treasures. We can't let them fall into
        the hand of orcs...
Baker:  We...
Thor:   Perfect! This is a great chance for some exercises!
Baker:  Thanks, Thor. Be careful, Shan.
Shan:   No problem. I will just hide behind you. You will protect me!
Baker:  ...Uh. All right, let's go!

---Strategy---

This chapter is not hard AT ALL if you just want to pass it. The real purpose
here is getting the treasures from orcs. Orc warrior or leader will grab the
treasures from the chests and run away. They will disappear with the treasures
as they reach the border of the map. So you have to grab the treasures before
they do, or kill them before they escape with treasures.
This is a total test of how strong your team is. The better your team is, the
easier it is for you to get all treasures. After Go Extreme, I have 3 upgraded
characters: Marlene, Dino, and Shelia. I simply go forth and tear a crap out of
them. I let Marlene go nuts with Teleport and easily got all treasures.
If your team isn't so good, you should at least get Gem of Star if you want to
play secret level. Also you should get the weapon and armor for Gaia, the
Elixir.

After all the orcs are killed or escaped:

---Dialogue---

Shan:  With your help we were able to drive the orc. I give sincere gratitude
       on behalf of the Elf Elders.
Alex:  No problem. Baker, it's nice to meet your friend from childhood. Aren't
       you going to stay and catch up with her?
Baker: The quest we have is just too important. Elf Forest is my homeland, I
       would love to stay here with Shan. But I must keep going...
Shan:  Very important quest? Tell me! Tell me! It must be very exciting!
Baker: Shan, this is a really serious matter...
Shan:  What? You think I am just kidding with you? That's it! I am coming with
       you! I will find out what this whole SERIOUS quest is.
Baker: No Shan, this is a very dangerous quest. You should stay here...
Shan:  How can I not worry about you if this is a dangerous quest! Give me a
       little credit. I AM after all, the student of ArchMage Mooler.
Baker: Ai... I always lose when argue with you. After all, you would make some
       troubles if you stay here anyway. All right, come with us.
Shan:  Woo-hoo! Thanks! My name is Shan, it's great to meet you all!
Thor:  Welcome! Then, would you like to guide us out of this forest?
Shan:  Of course! Come with me.

---Go Extreme---

Well, I did Go Extreme again here. I have some characters with high defense. It
is not hard to surround 3 orc leaders for me. After that the torture begins...
By the end of this chapter, I have Reed, Lorna, and Harold at level 40, ready
for upgrading.

---New Character Analyse---

Shan
After Yoni with Fire magic, Shan joins as a Lighting spell-caster. I must say
she is a very hard character to use. Her status doesn't increase a lot as she
levels; her only useful spell in later part of the game is God's Thunder and
Holy Bolts if you upgrade her in Saint. It's a choice of yours to decide using
her or not. The reasons I decide to use her are: taking a challenge, also she
is the girlfriend of Baker...
Shan needs Ring of Saint to become a Saint instead of Archmage.

A Dragon Swordman enters, chased by large group of orcs.

        rest there...
Harold: Hey... there are something ahead.
Baker:  Hmm... group of orcs again, and...

Dragon Swordman sees Thor and others

Dragon: Great! Someone is coming... Help me!
Shan:   Why are you chased by these orcs? Tell me? I want to know!
Dragon: Help me with these orcs. I will tell you why and another big secret!
Shan:   Sound interesting. I agree...
Baker:  Shan! Don't make troubles...
Alex:   Don't worry. We need to pass this moutain, these orcs are on our way
        anyway. Right Thor?
Thor:   Thanks for understanding, Alex. Why are we even talking? Let's go!
Alex:   Hehe... this guy...

---Strategy---

Another Rescue or Lose chapter. Push forward as usually, the Dragon Swordman
will run at your direction. You should support him as soon as possible. Extreme
players really have some upper hand here with Teleport magic from Marlene. But
don't leave the Dragon Swordman behind by himself. As long as you defeat the
orc leader:

---Dialogue---

Orc Leader: Oh... but this is not the end...

Two group of enemies come out of the caves.

---Strategy---

Simple, kill them all while ensure the safety of the Dragon Swordman.

---Dialogue---

Dragon:  My name is Miostud. Thanks for saving my life.
Shan:    Mio... ok, this is a long name. Didn't you say you know some secret?
         Tell me! Tell me!
Miostud: Hehe, you may not be interested in this secret, but I will tell you
         anyway. Last night I overheard something form orc camp. They are going
         to attack the capital of Elf, Hasmia...
Baker:   WHAT! They are attacking my homeland?!
Shan:    Oh no! We must go back there fast to warn them!
Sophia:  But Hasmia is the capital city of Elf... How dare those orcs attacking
         the elves?
Miostud: Well... I did see huge amount of orcs gathered. I don't think they are
         just here camping, right?
Baker:   That's not important already. We have to get to Hasmia fast. We must
         help our people. I'm sorry, I need you guys' help again.
Thor:    Not a problem! How can we just sit and watch while these orcs invade
         Elves. We should be on our way, hopefully we will make it on time.

---Go Extreme---

Well, there is only one orc leader, and you have to kill him before the second
wave arrives. I only Go Extreme with Marlene, Shan, and Sophia. I let the four
Necromancer throw Sky Lighting at the characters, let Marlene and Sophia heal
and get good experience. By the end of the chapter I have Sophia and Shan above
level 30.

---New Character Analyse---

Miostud
First Dragon Swordman joins in! Well, there isn't much special thing about this
class. Dragon Swordman will upgrade to Dragon SwordMaster. Basically they are
like Sword Masters with better mobility but without Skill.

---Dialogue---

Thor and others enter

Baker:   Ah! We are still too late! The attack already begins!
Shan:    Hmm... it's ok. It seems all the villagers retreated already. There
         are only some archers left fighting the orcs...
Miostud: They haven't broken into the village yet... then Gem of Fire may not
         have been taken away...
Alex:    What was that?
Miostud: Nothing... let's go help them!
Thor:    That's right! It's time to kick some orcs' butts!

---Strategy---

If all elves archers die, you will lose. Go fast to help. Don't let the elves
kill too much enemies. First they will grab the experience away, second there
are some really nice treasures on some of th enemies. Also let absolutely NO
enemies escape with treasures. Make sure you grab the Gem of Fire for secret
chatpers. At round 5, Hart from Chapter One will show up:

---Dialogue---

Hart:   Dear god! What the hell is going on here?
Harold: Dad? Why are you here?
Hart:   To visit a friend! Why everything is in chaos here?
Harold: Orc attacks. The villagers have retreated. We are trying to drive them
        away.
Hart:   Orc? Hum! They are asking for it, alright. Let me give them some good
        taste of my axe! Keep it up, son!
Harold: Yes, dad!
Thor:   Hart! Nice to have you again.

---Strategy---

Push the enemies away from the camp, let Thor walk to place at (25, 6), in
front of a tent. An elder will speak to him and give the Badge of Bravery:

---Dialogue---

Elder: It's hard to believe a young man like you possess this kind of power...
       I see something special about you. Here, take this Badge. We can't let
       this fall into the wrong hand...
Thor:  Thanks... this badge is...?
Elder: You will find out in time. Keep it for me...

---Strategy---

At about round 10, there will be a reinforcement of the enemy. Just kill them
all:

---Dialogue---

Elf One: Baker? Shan? Can't believe it's you guys. Also Uncle Hart, it has been
         a while. Thank goodness you came in time, there is no way we can drive
         them away ourselves.
Elf Two: But how did all know about the orcs?
Shan:    Just a coincidence, and these friends wanted to help as well. How are
         the villagers?
Elf One: Our scouts found out about the orcs. All the town folks have retreated
         last night. But I heard there are a even larger group gathered near
         Hasmia at the Plain of Landi. The situation is still quite...
Baker:   Hmm... why would orcs attack Hasmia? I still have no clue.
Elf Two: We don't know either. Before the battle they were saying about killing
         the entire elves race. They didn't give us a reason.
Thor:    Come on, people! How simple could this be? Didn't he just say there is
         a huge group of orcs at Plain of Landi? Here is what we are gonna do:
         we will go there, give them a total kick in the butt. We will leave
         some of them alive and ask any questions we have!
Alex:    This plan is totally Thor-styled. But... it's not a bad idea.
Shelia:  Yes. It's risky allowing them camp beside Hasmia. It's a good idea to
         take care of them on the plain instead of bring the battle into the
         city again.
Yoni:    Uncle Hart has arrived at the perfect time. It should not be a problem
         at all for us to wipe them out together.
Hart:    Of course! These orcs aren't enough for me to kill. Beside I want to
         see how much stronger my boy has become. Hahaha.
Thor:    Perfect, we will rest a bit and be on our way.

---Go Extreme---

Don't Go Extreme in this chapter. Either Hart or the elves will try to kill
any enemies alive, and you can't let any of them die. So just grab all the
treasures, kill everything and pass the chapter.
Also remember to shoot yourself if you forget about the Badge of Bravery.

---New Character Analyse---

Hart
He is almost exactly the same as Harold. He is quite strong at the time he
join the team. Not a bad choice to upgrade him into a Bersker. It's up to you
to use him or not.
Hart needs Badge of Platina to become a Berserker instead of a Holy Warrior.

Thor:    Speak! Why are you orcs here? Tell us or go with your partners!
Orc:     But... but... I really don't know. Our leader Carl told us to gather
         here four days ago. We are to attack the elf city Hasmia, one of our
         group has gone away and hasn't returned yet. Then... you all came...
Alex:    Fool... we already sent your first group to hell. Now why does orc
         leader Carl want to attack Hasmia? Tell us now!
Orc:     I really don't know! All I know is, Carl mentioned killing all elves
         and making sure that we take all treasures. That's all I know...
Miostud: What treasure?
Orc:     How could I possibily know that? Please let me go... I promise I will
         leave this place and never come back forever!
Thor:    Fine, one more question then you can go. Where is Carl?
Orc:     Our leader? He is leading another group attacking the panther village
         at Lake Kala. He should still be there right now. I haven't told you
         everything you want. Can I please go now?
Thor:    All right. Get out of here.
Orc:     Than... Thanks...

The orc runs away.

Alex:   Thor, you let him go before everybody agrees with you.
Baker:  That's ok, we already found out what we need to know. But things look
        more serious than we thought...
Harold: Something isn't right... Where do the orcs get the guts to attack Elf
        and Panther at the same time?
Shelia: Good point! I think there must be someone behind the orcs. As far as I
        know, orcs alone don't dare to do these things.
Shan:   Hmm... Panthers are one of the most powerful race on Land of Mara. But
        they normally don't act in group. They will have trouble handling big
        battle like this. We'd better go to Lake Kala, maybe we can help them.
Baker:  Lake Kala isn't far from here. There is a small town on the way, why
        don't we go for a rest first.
Thor:   Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!

---Go Extreme---

This chapter is made for Go Extreme. It's up to you to choose what type of them
you want to leave behind. There are Dark Priest, Necromancer, Dark Archer, Orc,
and Orc Leader. They are all pretty good targets. There is only one treasrue in
this chapter, there is nobody need to be rescued, there is no reinforcement for
you so nobody will mess things up, the enemies don't escape. A perfect chapter.
I have Sophia, Shan, Yoni, Carrie, and Miostud at level 40.

Carl notices.

Carl: Hmm? Somebody is here to make troubles? Very well, send them all to hell.

As Theodore and panthers back away to the edge of cliff.

Theodore: There is no turning back! We will fight them with our last breath!

---Strategy---

Another rescue or lose chapter. Once again the strength of your team decides
everything. If Marlene already got teleport then great, teleport some powerful
characters there and finish the business. If not, then tear through the first
enemy wave as far as you can. Slay the small group, then push forward together.
By the way, let one strong character (for example Alex as Dragon Knight) go to
the North-East corner of the map without going near other enemies. At round 8,
4 orcs warrior will appear at North-East corner:

---Dialogue---

Orc One: Ah! It seems we are late...
Orc Two: Sir Carl commanded us to take hidden path with these treasures... It's
         reasonalbe for us to be late...
Orc One: How do things go here?

An orc Leader sees them.

Leader:  Hey! Aren't you guys the treasures delivering squad? What are you all
         doing here?
Orc One: Sir Carl commanded us to bring the treasures here to him, and...
Leader:  Fool! Can't you see things aren't looking good here? Take the treasure
         away with you, deliver them to Els Island!
Orc One: Ye... Yes sir!
Orc Two: Quickly! Retreat!

---Strategy---

***Attention***
Make sure Alex or whatever character you choose has room for 4 items. Kill four
orcs and rob the treasures off them. One of them has Dragon Egg which is not so
important, second one has a Elixir of Power which is quite nice, third one has
Ring of Saint which is quite useful. (not for me because I already got 3 Saints
at chapter 13) The most important is the forth one with Gem of Light! This is
another key to the secret levels, make sure you get it! If you don't act fast
enough, four orcs will retreat away at round 12 and you can kiss secret levels
goodbye. At the same time you are beating up these delivering boys...

---Dialogue---

Carl:    Why is everything taking so long? Second Squad, attack!

As the Gem of Light is found.

Miostud: Oh... The Gem of Light! Why are the orcs getting their hands on it?
Shan:    The legendary gems of heaven... Master Mooler mentioned these gems
         have magic in them that is so powerful nobody has ever figured out a
         way of using them. But why do orcs want these for?
Miostud: You know about it as well? I heard these aren't just gems with magic
         power, they are actually the key of a ancient secret...
Thor:    What are you two talking about? Sounds interesting...
Miostud: We will tell you later, let's finish the businese at hand.

---Strategy---

Carl is quite a powerful warrior, use the same old trick of lure and kill. If
you are a Go Extreme player... do whatever you want. As you beat him to the
ground:

---Dialogue---

Carl: Master, save me... You promised me the eternal life and strength...
Thor: Ah! Damn it! I think we hit too hard... now we don't have anyone to ask
      questions to...

After the battle.

Theodore: Thanks for your help, we were able to survive this battle. We panther
          respect warriors with pride like you people.
Carrie:   No problem, bro. These friends haven't helped many on their way.
Theodore: Thanks again. By the way, Carrie? Did you see orcs appear in other
          locations beside here?
Carrie:   Oh yes! First they went to attack elf city Hasmia, then we found with
          them on Plain of Landi. We are so tired of seeing orcs all the time.
Theodore: Is that true? Then there IS someone behind this plotting the scheme.
Alex:     What do you mean?
Theodore: Recently my scouts reported to me that some power incite the orcs and
          berserker around Dark Forest. They're going to launch an annihilation
          toward all Elves and Panthers. I was sure about information, but I
          came back to check things out. So I met these orcs here...
Baker:    Yup, same thing happened to Hasmia. Our homeland almost got destroyed
          under the ruthless attack of these beasts. But who is behind this...
Theodore: I don't know either. However one of my friends told me even larger
          groups of orcs and berserkers are gathering at the Ice Land at the
          North. She already went away for that. I am also going to join her up
          there as long as things are settled here.
Sophia:   Interesting... Jonah went to the same direction. Perhaps we are all
          aftering the same thing here...
Alex:     Then why don't we all go together?
Thor:     Agree! I am quite looking forward to meet the one behind the curtain!
          Let's move out!

---Go Extreme---

The only thing keeps you from Go Extreme is Theodore and those panthers. Luckly
I found the trick here: Theodore and panthers will follow Thor if there aren't
enemies near. So quickly kill all the enemies around Theodore so he will start
moving toward Thor. Let Thor walk to where you start and let Theodore follow...
Then you can do whatever you want again.
By the way, jump out of your window if you forget to get the Covenant of Fairy
for Yoni.

---New Character Analyse---

Theodore
Second Fight joins the team. However he isn't comparable to Carrie. Level both
Carrie and Theodore to level 40 than change them to Kong-Fu Lord. You will see
Theodore is way behind in Damage and Defense. In the whole gmae there is only
one Book of Apperception. I suggest using Carrie.
Theodore needs Book of Apperception to become a Kong-Fu Lord.

Thor and others enter

Alex:     Geez it's cold... Lotoria never has this kind of weather...
Theodore: I don't know if she has arrived yet? We should be able to find some
          clues if she is here...
Hart:     Hmm... it's easy to see afar here... Hey! There are someone battling
          over there...
Theodore: Oh... that's her!

A well equipped woman is surrounded by enemies.

Woman:    Theodore? You are right on time, I have a little trouble here. Are
          those your new friends?
Theodore: Yes! These are friends aftering the same thing as we are. They are
          here to help.
Woman:    Perfect, that will save me some time. Tell you friends to hurry up.
          We have many things to take care of after this battle.
Alex:     Theodore, is this lady the friend of yours?
Theodore: Yes, she is the Sword Master Minnie. She has been living alone in the
          mountains for years to achieve better sword mastery.
Reed:     It's her? She was the leader of Royal Guards years ago. There are
          quite some legends about her. I heard she was so into sword mastery
          that she left the Royal Guards. Can't believe we meet her here.
Shelia:   Why would someone like her appear here?
Theodore: I think somebody who is respected enough, that she agrees to help out
          here. I met her a while ago. Knowing we are aftering the same goal we
          decided to meet her.
Sophia:   That means... Jonah may be the one invited her here...
Thor:     Whatever, this is such a bossy lady. She starts giving orders without
          even introducing herself. I don't care if she is some Sword Master, I
          don't need anyone tells me what to do.
Alex:     Well then Thor. Show her what we got, let her know warriors like us
          from Lotoria are not to be underestimated.
Thor:     Well said! We will let her see who we really are. Everybody move out!

---Strategy---

Another rescue chapter. However don't even compare Minnie to Theodore. She is
a very powerful Sword Master. You can easily pass this level. But having Minnie
join your team will be a different thing here. In order for Minnie to join you,
three conditions must be satisfied:
Thor has more than 320 HP when the chapter is finished;
At least four of Minnie's soldiers must survive;
The chapter must be finished in 18 rounds.

If you don't satisfy these conditions, Minnie will help out in chapter 17 then
leave the team.

Not so easy now, is it? Once again it's the strength of your team that matters.
You also need to grab the only Book of Apperception as well, so this is a busy
chapter if you want to get everything. I have a Go Extreme team and I get all
treasures, saved all Minnie's soldiers, Thor's HP was never under 500, and I
finished the chapter in 10 rounds. You can still achieve everything within 18
rounds if you didn't Go Extreme, but it will take some planning...

One more thing, there are some Ninjas who picks up treasures and runs... so
watch out for that as well.

If you accomplished everything and send the enemies to hell before round 18:

---Dialogue---

Minnie:   Well fought! That was the art of grouping battle. I personally admire
          your abilities.
Lorna:    You have also shown us some unique sword masteries today. It was
          quite a eye-opener.
Minnie:   Thanks. Now I believe I know the reason everyone is here for. I also
          believe we are after the same thing. My scouts reported that large
          group of enemies gathered on Els Island. I will take everyone there,
          we will annihilate them all at once. Is there any objection?
Thor:     I have some objections!
Alex:     Thor? What?
Minnie:   You have objections? Ok, tell us what it is.
Thor:     Since you admit we are outstanding warriors, then why would we want
          to be lead by you? This is how it should be: you will JOIN our team
          and be the guide for the team. Isn't that right?
Carrie:   Thor, Minnie is highly respected Sword Master. At least you...
Thor:     No need. The one rules in battle should be the one in charge. That is
          always how I do things.
Minnie:   Hehe, such a young man like you has such outstanding feats and guts.
          I like that. Very well, I have lived alone for quite some years, I
          can't remember how it feels to be lead by other...
          Sword Master Minnie will JOIN your team. It's nice to meet you all.
Theodore: Unbelievable... Minnie, both beautiful and powerful Sword Master bent
          her will for Thor...
Alex:     This is the blood of the king inside Thor. He has what it takes to
          command others and make others agree to be commanded... King Reter is
          right to choose him as the future king...
Baker:    Well then, Ms. Minnie. Would you take us to Els Island now?
Minnie:   I already joined your team, so you can all call me Minnie now. Right?
          Thor?
Thor:     Hum! I don't care about these little things, let's go!

***Extra Note***
If you don't satisfy the conditions, Minnie will have a much more unfriendly
conversation with you. She will still join your team, but she will leave after
chpater 17.

---Go Extreme---

Well, you CAN Go Extreme easily here. But do you really want to give up Minnie
and her Sonic Sword?

---New Character Analyse---

Minnie
After so much trouble, this proud Sword Master finally joined us. She is a very
powerful character, good damage, high defense, although magic defense is a bit
low... Also behold the unique skill she will gain after leveling: Sonic Sword!
At later part of the game, you can watch Minnie killing 4 enemies in each round
with this supernature powerful skill.
Minnie is already a Sword Master, she can't upgrade to another class.


***Attention***
From this point the game will start getting into the climax. The enemies will
also become stronger and more dynamic. This is where things begin to get tough
for normal players, also this is where Go Extreme start paying off.

---Dialogue---

Thor and others enter

Minnie: Just like we expected. So many enemies gathered on such a small island.
        They must be up to something...
Hart:   Let me see... Oh... So many Orcs and Dark Warriors... and some creature
        that I have never seen before... This will be quite a battle...
Alex:   Minnie, what is our strategy?
Thor:   Why ask? Kill them all, then all problems will be solved.
Minnie: I must say I agree with Thor. It's better than sit and do nothing.
Alex:   Right, we came all the way to find out who is behind of curtain. There
        is no back away now.
Harold: Careful, the enemies have noticed us.

An Unknown being, appear to be a woman at the center of the island.

Woman:  Sword Master Minnie, you have finally arrived. I heard you have been
        searching this area with your scouts. Hmm... you also brought someone
        to be buried with you. This small island will have quite a show today.
Baker:  Minnie, is this strange creature the one behind the orc attacks?
Minnie: I believe so. Don't underestimate her because her strange shape... I
        sense great magic power on her. This is a powerful foe we are up agaist
        here. Be careful Thor.
Thor:   It's fine. Everybody attack!
Woman:  Such a tasteless mortal. I was going to chat with you a bit longer...
        Since you can't wait to go to hell... I will let you all disappear...

---Strategy---

This chapter is rather a turning point in the game. All enemies are much more
powerful than before. The mighty Orc Leaders are just minions in this chapter.
Powerful Dark Warriors and Necromancers that cast Dragon Fire spell! Also there
are three Dark Knights guarding the Ice Goddess. Your team is divided into four
small groups. Advance together, watch out for the Dragon Fire. At round four,
Minnie's soldiers will arrive:

---Dialogue---

Soldiers: Master Minnie, we are here to aid you!

---Strategy---

These soldiers are quite decent helpers, but they are up against Dark Knights,
Dark Warriors, and Necromancers. You have to push in as well. Ice Goddess can
cast God's Favour, which is a very powerful healing spell. She has quite some
decent damage too. Beat her up with your best characters. As for the Go Extreme
players, this is the chapter your hard work pays off. My team has tore the
enemies line up like nothing. As Ice Goddess falls:

---Dialogue---

Ice Goddess: How could I be defeated by these worthless mortals... save me...
             master...
             (Gem of Ice is found from Ice Goddess)
Miostud:     Oh? This is... the Gem of Ice! She has one of the legendary gems.
Minnie:      You know about the legend of "Gems of God" as well?
Miostud:     Yeah, I have been searching for these gems for years after hearing
             this legend. But why the enemies have one of them, why are they
             searching for other gems...?
Minnie:      This is exactly what we are trying to find out. As far as I know,
             they aren't planning to do anything good with these gems. Hmm...
             we will talk after this battle.
Miostud:     Right, victory is at hand.

After all enemies have been defeated.

Minnie:  So this strange creature is called Ice Goddess... She seems to be the
         same kind with the Rock Demon you fought when you were rescuing the
         king. Their true purpose is still a mystery... hmm, we still have
         quite a long way to go. Is everyone with me going after this scheme?
Thor:    But we are hoping to find Saint Jonah, he can help Yoni get her memory
         back...
Minnie:  Jonah? He is the one lead this whole thing... Jonah has called the
         best of all warriors, priests, sorceresses, knights... on the entire
         Land of Mara. He hopes everyone will get together and challenge this
         unknown darkness. I thought you all knew about it...
Sophia:  Jonah did ask me to meet him in Dark Forest, but I didn't know why.
         Now I understand...
         (A Dragon Sword Master came in)
Dragon:  Hey! Did you people defeat the Ice Goddess?
Thor:    Of course! Uh... where did you come from? Are you with them?
Dragon:  Relax, I am Dragon Guard Keynes. I was ordered to scout this place,
         but I was tricked by these creatures and captured a while ago. I just
         broke out of the prison and came to check things out...
Alex:    It's over now. We have defeated Ice Goddess and her followers.
Keynes:  Really? It's quite impressive you guys managed to defeat her. Why did
         you fight against her?
Thor:    Do we need a reason? Although we are just looking for Jonah, we still
         can't sit and watch them do all these evils to innocent people.
Alex:    We have fought them along our way. More and more friends joined us on
         our journey. Since Jonah is the one lead the way, we are glad to lend
         him a hand.
Keynes:  I see. King Lucas is also invited by Jonah. We have scouted many
         places due to our flight ability. His highness has gone to the Westen
         Desert, I came here to Ice Land, but I didn't think they were
         gathered here...
Miostud: His highness himself has joined as well? Hmm... this is probably
         getting really serious.
Keynes:  Yes... I was imprisoned for so long that I missed the day I supposed
         to meet his highness...
Miostud: You can join us right now. His highness will meet with Jonah
         eventually, we are looking for Jonah as well. You will be able to
         meet his highness with us...
Keynes:  Sounds good, but...
Alex:    Dragons are noble warriors as I know. Welcome to our team.
Thor:    That's right. There is no shame being captured. Come with us and get
         them back later.
Keynes:  Thank you.
Thor:    Perfect. All right, I am tired of looking at this ice place. Sophia,
         where are we heading next?
Sophia:  We should cross the moutain road on the north, and go to Plain of...
Hart:    That's a outlandish path, there aren't many people taking that road.
         We should have a nice walk... hahaha!
Thor:    Very well, move out!

***Extra Note***
Keynes will join ONLY if Minnie has joined your team at last chapter.

---Go Extreme---

The soldiers will try to kill any enemies remain. Place your characters so that
those soldiers can't reach the enemies. Don't bother with those Necromancers,
even after they run out of MP, they will use their Magic Staff to attack. Leave
some Dark Warriors and Orc Leaders will be fine.

---New Character Analyse---

Keynes
Truth to be told, he is not a very powerful Dragon Sword Master. Not even close
compare with well trained Miostud. Use him if you want, but I don't.

Thor and others enter

Alex:   Wow, this is a long hanging bridge. It must be tough building this...
Thor:   Where does this bridge lead us to?
Sophia: After this bridge we will quickly go down to ground. Pass the Plain of
        Swit, we will arrive Black Marsh...
Hart:   Hmm? Someone is already on the bridge...
Harold: I see a Paladin Knight and a Elderly man...
Baker:  Elderly...? Can it be...
Sophia: That's him all right! Jonah!

Jonah and the knight see them.

Jonah: Ah... Baker! Sophia! And you brought so many friends with you! When did
       you come?
Baker: We have just arrived. It's great to see you again...
Jonah: I heard you guys made quite some successes along the way. I am sure you
       all will be powerful aid against the darkness we are facing...
Shan:  Watch out! There are someone behind you, Jonah!

Large group of demons and other enemies, lead by the Dark Raider.

Demon:    Hehe, listen to what they just said... This is the Jonah we are
          looking for!
Raider:   Perfect... Listen up, bro! Slay this old fool and we will be well
          rewarded. Let's finish the business and enjoy our days afterward!
Minion:   Yeah! Let's go!
Hart:     Oh no! Judging from the texture on their armours... We are in for a
          big battle!
Alex:     What is it?
Hart:     If I remember correctly... This is a mercenary army called Skeleton
          of Death. These bastards often take over robbing and assassinating
          assignment... They do anything for money!
Reed:     I remember them as well! The Royal Elite Knights have given them an
          extermination years ago. I have never heart anything about them after
          that.
Baker:    They are here now... ah! Jonah is in danger!
Thor:     There are quite many of them, move out right away!
          (The knight with Jonah speaks)
Knight:   They are from the Skeleton of Death. It's us they are after...
Jonah:    Hmm... they finally made their move. Very well, I haven't had any
          movement lately. It will be nice to see how these friends take care
          our enemies. Are you all right there, Lancelot?
Lancelot: Don't worry! I will ensure your safety with my life!
Jonah:    Haha, save those words. This is not the first time we cooperate...
          There they come!

---Strategy---

This is the chapter that kills normal players. The enemies have been totally
upgraded. Dark Archer becomes Dark Sniper! Dark Warrior becomes Berserker!
Necromancer becomes Dark Witch! Basically this is the chapter where enemies
have their classes upgraded. Dark Knights from previous chatper are here with
Demons. All I can say is be careful. Jonah and Lancelot will go where Thor is,
so don't lead them into anywhere dangerous. Have your entire team push forward.
Make sure you do your work quick with the first wave of the enemies. After that
don't push in yet, take your time and regroup a bit. At round 8 few Berserkers,
Dark Knights, and Dark Sniper will appear at where you started:

---Dialogue---

Raider:  That old tool and knight still aren't dead? Ha guess they are tougher
         than we thought.
Warrior: Some other people are here helping them... our force sustained heavy
         casualties. Boss is right to send us as well.
Raider:  Very well, we will attack from behind. There is no way we will let
         them escape.
Warrior: Yeah! Time to kill!

---Strategy---

Once again make sure Jonah and Lancelot are safe. Take care of the new comers
with your strong characters. Then slowly advance in... The chapter will end as
soon as you kill the Dark Raider:

---Dialogue---

Raider:  Watch it... the others will take revenge for us...

Everyone gathers.

Jonah:   It's great to see you again, Baker, Sophia. I also see many familiar
         faces... as for these couple youngsters... How would you like me to
         call you?
Thor:    My name is Thor, this is my friend Alex and Yoni. We came from Land of
         Lotoria.
Jonah:   Lotoria? That's quite a long way... Why did you come so far away from
         homeland?
Thor:    Truth to be told, I am hoping you can cure Yoni and help her get her
         memory back...
Jonah:   Lost memory? This is beyond my ability... If it was caused by some
         spell, maybe I can try something. But there isn't much I can do if it
         was caused by impact on her head... Well, you came a long way here,
         let me take a look... Yoni, come closer please...
         (Yoni steps up, Jonah looks at her)
Jonah:   Hmm... interesting... very interesting! this is the first time I see
         such thing...
Thor:    What do you think, Jonah?
Jonah:   The bad news is... I can't help her due to some very interesting
         reasons. The good news is I may be able to tell you where she is from.
Thor:    That's fine. We were trying to take her home in the first place. So
         where did Yoni come from?
Jonah:   Not now, this actually has something to do with the ancient secret we
         are searching for. I can't give you the answer right now. But after we
         complete our journey you will have your answer.
Thor:    That means... (sigh)
Alex:    Don't be so depressed Thor. Why don't we finish this adventure with
         everybody? We may never have the chance to experience something like
         this ever again!
Shelia:  Yes, Thor. Without you, nobody will lead us in our battles.
Thor:    But I really want to get Yoni's memory back first...
Yoni:    Don't worry, Thor. I have a strange feeling about it. As long as we
         keep on this journey, I will find out everything about myself. I want
         to continue as well...
Thor:    Really? That's great! If this is how you feel, I have no objections.
Marlene: Yeah! Thor, Alex, Yoni, and Gaia are staying!
Baker:   Thor, there are many things we will need you for. Let's work together
         as a team just like we always had.
Thor:    Thanks, everybody.
Jonah:   Hahaha, good... But this isn't the place to talk, we should be on our
         way. There is a nice little village ahead, let's leave this dangerous
         place and get some rest.
Thor:    Agree. Let's go, everyone!

---Go Extreme---

First of all, if you are a Go Extreme player you will have a much much easier
time in this chapter. This chapter is also perfect for Go Extreme. Place your
character right in front of those Dark Witch and let them toss Dragon Fire at
you. Meanwhile use any of your characters with healing spells like Marlene,
Sophia, Shan as Saint, or Harold as Berserker... They will gain level crazily.
After that, you can again leave whatever enemies you want and make them suffer.
Same as previous chapter, but bother with those spell-casters. They have Magic
Staff which allows them to attack you with magic even when they are out of MP.

---New Character Analyse---

Jonah
Finally, the Saint Jonah has joined your team. He is quite a decent character,
although not as good as well-levelled Sophia and Marlene, but he is often
required present in many chapters. So it's a good idea to level him up well.
He has Rejuvenation and Holy Bolt spells, which are quite useful along the way.
Jonah is already a Saint, he can't have his class upgraded.

Lancelot
He is a mysterious Paladin Knight who guards Jonah with his life. Lancelot is a
decent character. As Paladin Knight, he has high mobility, decent damage, high
defense, high magic defense. For me, the way he attacks alone is enough reaon
to use him.
Lancelot is already a Paladin Knight, his class can't be upgraded.

***Extra Note***
This is a small spoiler for those people want a Flame Dragon 2 - Mark of Wind
walkthrough. Lancelot will be a powerful member of your team in that game.

---Dialogue---

Thor and others enter

Thor:    This forest doesn't make me comfortable. What is this place?
Jonah:   This is the Dark Forest of the North. The sunlight is blocked by
         forests and mists, so this place always looks very... charnel. Most
         travellers don't dare to cross this place.
Shelia:  After the Dark Forest we will arrive at the Black Marsh, also called
         Marsh of Death... I heard people are often attacked by unknown
         creatures there.
Hart:    I have a bad feeling... Everyone, be on your guard.
Harold:  You are right dad! Someone is approaching!
         (Massive forces from Skeleton of Death are gathered ahead)
Bersker: Jonah! Your damned fool! We lost many men to you last time. We have
         will take your life today!
Alex:    Huh! It's the Skeleton of Death again!
Thor:    These fools, today is the end of your road. I will end it for you!

---Strategy---

The enemies are divided into groups, the first two groups will advance on you
at the beginning of the game. Two new kinds of enemy appears: Dark Mercenary
and Dark Fighter. Watch out especially for those Dark Fighters, they use Poison
Claw. Also three enemy ninjas will grab three best treasures and escape. Stop
them on their tracks. Few rounds after:

---Dialogue---

A Dragon Sword Master appears from the South-West corner

Dragon:  Oh! The Skeleton of Death! Why are they here?! That means...
Keynes:  Hey! It's you! Barnard! What a nice coincidence!
Barnard: Keynes! Haven't seen you for quite a while. I can't believe I would
         meet here!
Keynes:  Barnard, now is not the best time to talk. Let's take care of the
         enemies who are trying to harm Jonah the Saint!
Barnard: Jonah is here? Great! Count me in!

---Strategy---

Another two groups of enemy will push toward you. Few round later, the last and
the biggest group will come. I wouldn't say this chapter is hard, you just have
to take your time. It will be challenging getting all the treasures, but if you
have Teleport spell that won't be a problem. After you finish the work:

---Dialogue---

Bernard: Well fought! I have never seen such a mighty group of adventurers!
Keynes:  Bernard, aren't you with his highness?
Barnard: You are sent by his highness, right?
         We discover the Skeleton of Death appears near the Marsh of Death. So
         his highness sent me to secretly follow them...
Jonah:   I see, where is he now?
Barnard: His highness found out something about the enemy. He went to the Tower
         of Sky on the West. I think he is still on his way...
Baker:   Tower of Sky? You mean Tower of Holy Spirit!? That's where our elves
         rised at the very beginning! Our heritage lies there! The enemies are
         after that place? What do they want to do?
Jonah:   It doesn't matter anyway. Right now we must hurry and catch up with
         King of Dragon Lucas himself. It seems he has discovered something
         important. We have to speed up in the next few days... Is everyone
         all right?
Thor:    Not a problem! You should take care of yourself as well...
Jonah:   Hahaha, thanks for your concern, Thor. Let's be on our way then...

---Go Extreme---

Well, it's another Go Extreme chapter. Use enemies' Dragon Fire spell to level
up your healing character. Then kill the Dark Witches and leave any enemies you
want. I basically left the entire last group alive, include the Bersker leader,
four Dark Raiders, four Dark Fighters. After crazy leveling, Shan has became a
level 40 Saint! Both Baker and Shelia have become a level 40 Marksman! Lancelot
levelled to 21, Jonah also gained 10 levels. Many characters are at level 30 to
35 with second class.

---New Character Analyse---

Bernard
He is a one of those strong characters who come in late. With proper levelling
he can match Miostud. It's not a mistake to use him.
Bernard is already a Dragon Sword Master, he can't change class.

---Dialogue---

Thor and others enter

Jonah:  Huh? The area of the marsh seems to be increasing... Here was still
        covered by forest a while ago...
Alex:   Marsh eats up the forest? I have never heard such thing.
Sophia: The Marsh of Death is the most evil-influent place on Land of Mara.
        Anything can happen in this place, be careful everyone.
Hart:   Hold it! I heard sound of battling...

A Panther and Elves Archers are surrounded by dark enemies.

Panther:      Damn it! The rumor about this place is true...
Archer One:   I still can't believe it. there are actually invisible monsters.
Archer Two:   Well, time to believe it... I was bit by one of them...
Dark Minion:  Accept your fates, fools...
Dark Fighter: We were commanded. Whoever enters this marsh will never leave...
Archer One:   (to the panther)Seymour, what should we do?
Seymour:      Fight to the end...
Dark Minion:  Then die!
Harold:       They said there are invisible monsters here!
Jonah:        Really? That could be a big threat to us...
Alex:         Why don't we go help those guys right now. Together we have a
              better chance...
Thor:         I agree! We are not going to watch those elves killed by our
              enemies...
Jonah:        Then let's go... be careful guys...

---Strategy---

This is one of the hardest chapters. If Seymour dies, you will lose. If all elf
archers die you will lose. There are powerful enemies around them: Dark Fighter
with high damage, Dark Minion in Sword Master class, Dark Raider with both high
mobility and damage, and the Dark Berserker with Sword of Earth that grand them
totally unreasonable damage! Seymour and elves need your help but to help them,
you need to cross the marsh. Any non-flying character will suffer HUGE decrease
of mobility in the marsh. both your damage and defense will also decrease while
you are in the marsh. Worst comes to worse, There are invisible monsters in the
marsh! Those creatures can't be seen, they have high damage with poison ability
which is a major pain in the butt. Also if you want Dirksen joining the team at
the end of the chapter, you will have to kill all enemies and get all treasures
within 15 rounds.

So... very hard, isn't it. I have two words: Go Extreme, if you want to have it
all, you need Go Extreme. If you are a normal player then you will just have to
give up something. Place Seymour at the stair so only two enemies can attack at
each round. The enemy will leave him alone if you can use Seymour to defeat the
first wave. The invisible monsters in the marsh cannot be checked. You can only
use some flying characters to detect where they are. Then move beside them, and
FORCE your character to attack them. Whatever you choose to give up you have to
grab the Gem of Darkness if you want to enter the secret chapters.

For Go Extreme players, go nuts with Teleport! I didn't even need to cross that
marsh. I grabbed all treasures, killed all enemies in 9 rounds.

After your work is finished:

---Dialogue---

Seymour and the remaining Elves get together with Thor and others.

Jonah:   That was a really tough battle. But with the bless of heaven we were
         able to prevail. How did you guys get yourself into this place?
Seymour: We were travelling through this marsh. The dark enemies and invisible
         monsters appeared out of nowhere and attacked us... If it wasn't your
         help, we would die long ago.
Barnerd: Why would they block the way to North... Maybe they don't want us to
         go there...
Archer:  This probably has something to do with the dark force attacking Tower
         of Holy Spirit...
Baker:   What?! They really attacked the Tower of Holy Spirit?
Archer:  Yes... we are the elves who guarded the holy tower for generations...
         We are attacked by enormous amounts of dark enemies, so we were sent
         to ask help from Hasmia. But the enemy has already prepared a trap for
         us here...
Shan:    What secrets does our holy tower hold? Why would they want the tower
         so badly?
Archer:  We don't know either. Nobody has entered that tower for centuries. But
         the elders believe nothing good will happen if the tower falls into
         the hand of our enemy...
Baker:   I see... Hasmia was also under sieged and sustained heavy casualty,
         there is no point for you to go there. We will go reinforce at Tower
         right away!
Archer:  Thank you very much. We will catch up with you guys later...

The elf archers leave.

Jonah:   You are a ninja, Seymour? I rarely see people of this class now. what
         do you intent to do now?
Seymour: I have been living in forest peafully for many years. I thought my
         swords will be hang up on the wall forever. but it seems I was wrong.
         I want to fight the darkness that is threating this land, can I join
         you guys?
Alex:    You are more than welcome, you will be part of our team from now on.

***Note***
The event below will happen only if you complete the chapter in 15 rounds:

A Demon enters.

Demon:   Gahula, xuhoola...
Barnerd: Hey... this is a demon, why is he here?
Jonah:   He doesn't seem to be aggressive... too bad I don't understand demon
         language...
Yoni:    What was that? Can you say it again?
Demon:   Gahula, xuhoola...
Yoni:    Uh... I understand, we will help you about it...
Thor:    Yoni? You understand his language?
Yoni:    Yes... I understand what he is saying, but I don't really know why I
         can understand...
Jonah:   It's ok, Yoni. What is it he want?
Yoni:    He said his name is Dirksen, and he is a warrior in the demon elite
         force. He grows suspicious about his king due to some weird events,
         for that he was cast into prison here... He just escaped because we
         defeated the enemies...
Jonah:   Demon is involved as well. this is more troublesome than I thought...
         What can we do for Dirksen?
Yoni:    He said the king of demons is controlled by something... He want to
         join us and fight the dark forces because he can't watch his nation
         falls under some unknown enemies...
Barnerd: Can we trust him...? He IS a demon...
Thor:    That's fine! As long he has the desire to fight the darkness he can be
         a part of the team! We need to trust other if we want others to trust
         us!
Jonah:   I agree! But there is no time for talking now. We must go to the tower
         right away!
Thor:    Right! Let's go!

---Go Extreme---

The elf archers will follow Seymour so they don't mess things up. If you want
to Go Extreme, you will have to give up Dirksen. It's up to you.

---New Character Analyse---

Seymour
The only Ninja class character in this game. He has decent damage and very good
defense, he also process some spells. He isn't so bad if you level him up well.
Seymour's class can't be upgraded.

Dirksen
The class of Dirksen is unknown, it's more like a Fighter plus Berserker class.
He uses Fighter's weapon and Armour, he also has some of healing and boosting
spells. He isn't a bad choice if you want try something new.
Dirksen's class can't be upgraded.



***Attention***

At this point, you should have all five "Gems of God". You should have find the
Gem of Star in chapter 11, Gem of Fire in chapter 13, Gem of Light in chapter
15, Gem of Ice in chapter 17, and Gem of Darkness in chapter 20. If you missed
anyone of these gems, you can kiss secret level goodbye. If you have all these
gems, put them all on Thor before entering chapter 21. Also make sure one of
the character you choose to be present in the battle carries the Golden Badge
which is given to you at the end of chapter 10. The Golden Badge is carried by
Sophia by default. If you accidently sold one of those gems or the Gold Badge
to some shop, well... you can plan a way of suicide then...

Thor:  Phew, that was a long and boring trip...
Baker: Hopeful we will make it on time...
Shan:  This is normally where elves have their group meeting. Why does this
       place smell so bloody today...?
Hart:  The Skeleton of Death! They have surrounded the elves!

A elf elder, a elf markswoman, and other archers are surrounded.

Elder: Stop your day dreaming! I will rather die than submit myself to you!

A woman, appears to be the leader of Skeleton of Death.

Woman:      Know your place, old man! My master needs wise elder who possess
            magical power like you. Join us and you will be well treated...
Elder:      Save it! Elves are warriors with honour! Come and fight us!
Markswoman: I will not let you foul creatures touch Elder Hill!
Woman:      Guess I can only bring you back after turning you into corpses...
            Attack!
Alex:       Damn it! Skeleton of Death again!
Jonah:      It seems the Tower of Holy Spirit has fallen. These are the
            remaining elves... Come one! We have to save them, let's hurry!
Woman:      Someone else are coming...? Good! I was just thinking these elves
            are too little to kill.
Reed:       Martha! It's you! You still live...?
Martha:     Uh... Mr. Caption of Royal Elite Knights. Too bad... the Skeleton
            of Death was destroyed by your knights. But after all these years,
            I have rebuilt my army. The Skeleton of Death is only more powerful
            than ever!
Reed:       I wouldn't have let you go if I knew...
Martha:     Thank you for the mercy. But it was your choice to not clean the
            root. Now let's finish our business!
Thor:       Why are we even talking to these idiots. Let's go!

---Strategy---

This isn't a hard chapter. If the Markswoman Roland or Elder Hill dies you will
lose. They are supported by some elf archers and you are able to control Hill
and Roland. They can make it themselves if you manage it well. If any of your
characters have Teleport spell, then teleport one or two decent character with
them to help.

Your own team is divided into two group. As the battle begins, each group will
be attacked by four Dark Raiders and two Dark Snipers. From round 3 to round 9,
there are demons showing up to attack you. Each of these demons is able to cast
Lighting Fury once, so kill them fast or your team may be instant-killed. There
are also Dark Witches with Dragon Fire spell, so watch out a bit for that too.
For Go Extreme players, just play this chapter in any ways you want. Martha is
not hard to pick, but her weapon can shock your characters for 200+ damage. As
you beat her down:

---Dialogue---

Martha: Hum... I have to admit these kids are tough... well fought...
Reed:   Martha, why don't you have to come back to your old life after what
        happened...? You wouldn't have to die here only if...
Martha: Reed, I told you the blood of darkness is streaming in my vein... We
        aren't destined to be together... You don't have to... oh...
Reed:   Martha...

As all enemies are defeated.

Hill:   Phew... I thought we were all dead meat, hehe. Thank you all, for
        helping us defeat this mercenary army... I can't thank you enough...
Jonah:  Well, thank godness we arrived on time. So how is the Tower of Holy
        Spirit right now?
Hill:   The tower has fallen three days ago... to reduce casualty I ordered
        everyone to retreat away from the tower. So I don't really know how
        things are in there...
Jonah:  I understand. By the way, about the thing I asked you to research for
        me earlier... did you find some information?
Hill:   I spent three months reading in library and digging old ruins... All I
        was able to find is this staff and one conclusion.
Jonah:  Hmm... this is an interesting staff... so what is your conclusion?
Hill:   From the ancients ruins I found out: for the Key of the Sky you have
        mentioned, it is to be created by combining something called Golden
        Badge and five Ancient gems... This staff is for the combining those
        items and bringing out their true power. The Key of the Sky will allow
        human beings to overcome the limitation of time and space, and teleport
        them to an unknown ancient place...
Jonah:  Very interesting! So what do you think about it?
Hill:   What are there to think about? These items have been lost for 800 years
        ... When I was planning to search for these items, the dark force
        started the invasion...
Jonah:  I always thought the Key of the Sky has something to do with the dark
        force... But I guess we have to let it go for now since we don't have
        these items. We must find a new direction...

***Note***
The following dialogue will only appear if Thor has five Gems of God on him and
Golden Badge is carried by one of the present characters.

Thor: Hold on, Elder Hill. The gems and badge you talked about... Are these the
      gems you want?
Hill: (Surprised)Ah! Gems contain power of Fire, Ice, Light, Darkness, and Star
      ... this is it! How did you find them?
Thor: We just found them on our way here. The enemy seems to be interested in
      them as well. Took quite some effort to get them all...
Hill: This is perfect! Let's try it then! Everyone stay back a bit, this may be
      a little dangerous...

Hill initializes the ancient spell.

Hill: God from the unknown past! Time has come to fulfill your old covenant!
      Grand this staff its lost power! May the forgotten path to the unknown
      realm be reopen!

The staff, five gems, and the Golden Badge float around Hill.      

Hill: Maanadelaaa... Yaboolidga... Emmiheetera... Yeetocarnoal...

The Key of the Sky is created.

Hill:   It's completed! This is the Key of the Sky we have been looking for!
Jonah:  Unbelievable! I have finally seen the Key of the Sky after over ten
        years of searching... This is a gift from fate...
Alex:   Jonah, what is the purpose of this key?
Jonah:  I only know it has something to do with an ancient legend. The key will
        grand us to path to the sky... I don't know how it will be used...
Thor:   Geez... I thought we will be able to fly somewhere with it...
Jonah:  Don't worry, Thor. Our true enemy is connected with this key... We will
        find the answer soon enough... also the past of Yoni...
Thor:   I am glad to hear this...
Hill:   Anyway! We have to go back to the tower now! We must reclaim that place
        before the enemy does something in there! Roland, we are going as well!
Roland: Yes, elder! Others will take care of the rest.
Thor:   All right. Let's move out!

---Go Extreme---

Go right ahead with your characters. There are many enemies with spell casting
ability. You can use them to level up characters with healing spells. Afterward
you can leave some enemies alive for the torture of slashing and waiting. By
the end of this chapter I have six characters at level 40: Thor as Hero, Yoni
as Summoner, Marlene as Saint, Shelia as Markswoman, Baker as Marksman, Shan as
Archmage.

---New Character Analyse---

Hill
To be honest, he isn't a powerful character. Hill has low damage, low defense,
ok magic defense, low life. The only good thing about him is that he join the
team with the ability of casting God's Favour. The only reason I ever used him
is that he is require to be present in many chapters.

Roland
Now, you really don't have to use her unless you totally screwed up with Baker
and Shelia. Roland has low damage, low defense, she doesn't have what it takes
to kill anything. Just... forget the fact that you have this character...

Thor and others enter

Thor:   There wasn't a single enemy all the way through the tower... weird...
Alex:   Don't let your guard down. They are probably all waiting for us right
        here at the top...
Harold: You are right, Alex. They are all here...
Alex:   Hmm...

A strange creature is at the very top of the tower.

WindLord: You came earlier than I expected... No matter... I will get back to
          my business after sending you mortals away...
Hill:     Why do you want the Tower of Holy Spirit? This must have something to
          do with your dark scheme!
WindLord: Hahaha... None of you will leave this tower alive anyway... I will
          let you know... This tower is the tallest place there is in this
          entire land... My master from the sky wishes to create a portal here.
          That way, the army of his realm will arrive here...
Hill:     Your master from the sky? What kind of place did you all come from?
          Who is your master?
WindLord: My master is the dominator, the creator, and the destroyer... You do
          not have to know the rest... Prepare to die...
Thor:     It's you who needs to prepare to die!
Hill:     We don't know who are these enemies... Be careful...

---Strategy---

Right after the chapter starts, Dark Kong-Fu Fighters, Dark Sword Masters, Dark
Berserkers, and Dark Raiders will start attacking. This is a test of the power
of your team. Don't forget to use Yoni's summoning: Lord of Destruction when
things get tough. At round 4 and 6, demons will show up. All of them have the
ability to cast Lighting Fury. Don't let them get too close to you. At round 5:

---Dialogue---

A Dragon Knight breaks out of a window on the side of the tower.

Sarah:    Why is there such a battle on the tower? What's going on here...?
Thor:     Hi there! we are enjoying these actions. Stay away a bit if you don't
          want to get hurt!
Sarah:    Hey! Don't underestimate me like this. At least I am a Dragon Knight!
Hill:     Dragon Knight? I haven't heard this noble class for a long time...
          why is a Dragon Knight here?
Sarah:    Long story... I was captured by this Wind Lord. They imprisoned me
          here for days... I just heard sound of battling on the top of tower,
          so I broke the window and here I am!
Alex:     I see, what are you going to do now?
Sarah:    Fix this weird looking monster with you guys of course. I want to get
          him back!
WindLord: Hum! Loser, still didn't learn your lesson? Fine... I will not go
          easy on you this time...
Thor:     Whatever, taste my sword before all these big words!

---Strategy---

The enemies will not attack you after you finish off their attacking troops. So
push forward slowly step by step. The Wind Lord has decent physical damage, but
it doesn't kill your character much. The true threat is his God's Thunder spell
which is something you don't want to get hit by. The rest would be simple. f
course there are Dark Witches with Dragon Fire spell, but that should be that
much trouble anymore. Beat down the Wind Lord:

---Dialogue---

WindLord: How could these mortal be so... Master...!
Thor:     Oh! Not again! I forgot to leave him alive for questions...
Hill:     That's all right! We got this Staff of Teleport from him. We will be
          able to activate the portal with it and go to their base...

Soon all enemies are slain.

Jonah: Hill, the destination of this portal is unknown to us... if worst comes
       worst, we may not be able to return...
Hill:  Ai... this is the only way... We know the enemy will launch a enormous
       invasion upon this land, we have to go to them before they lay waste on
       our homeland... I am willing to sacrifice anything of myself to protect
       the land of Mara... I am prepared for the worst...
Jonah: I understand...

Hill walks on the portal.

Hill: I am going to launch the portal right now... whoever wants to come with
      me, stand beside me. Whatever you choose to do, it will be fine with me.

Everyone walks on the portal one after another.

Hill:   You...
Jonah:  How am I going to be able to look at myself in the mirror if I let you
        go through this portal alone? I don't want death upon myself, but I am
        not afraid of it either! What's more, I will certainly not forsake my
        friend!
Alex:   We have walked through so much danger throughout our journey. How can
        we turn our back at this point? I believe with the wisdom of you and
        Jonah, we will succeed!
Thor:   That's right! The most superior Sword Masters, Knights, Saints, Mages,
        Warriors, and Priests of entire land of Mara are standing right here!
        What kind of enemies are there that we can't defeat? Elder Hill!
        Believe in yourself! Believe in ourselves!
Hill:   Thanks... Thank you all for believing! Now! Let's launch this portal
        and challenge our ultimate foe!
Shelia: Ah! I can't wait to see what is on the side of this portal!

Hill launchs the portal.

Hill: Maradora... Garbulear... Emmiheatora... Eetuharlawa...

---Go Extreme---

This could be the last chapter that is perfectly suitable for Go Extreme. There
are many spell caster enemies, use them to level up your character with healing
spell. Leave as many enemies alive as possible to torture them good! At the end
of this chapter I have almost everyone at level 40, except Hill is level 26 and
Gaia is at level 98!

---New Character Analyse---

Sarah
I am sorry, but... she just sucks totally. Low damage, low defense, low magic
defense... the only good thing about her is the mobility. But hey, which Dragon
Knight doesn't have good mobility. Use her only if you want to annoy yourself.
Sarah is already a Dragon Knight. She can't change class.

---Dialogue---

Thor and others are teleported into a ruin.

Thor:  Phew! That was uncomfortable... Huh? Is this the base of our enemy? It
       doesn't look like so...
Jonah: I sensed strong magic interfering after the portal was launched... The
       teleporting was somehow disturbed... What do you think, Hill?
Hill:  Yup, we are lucky we survived this interfering. We could have all been
       teleport into cliff... But here isn't so far from where we should be...
Thor:  Damn it... probably it's the enemies' work again...

Two people are already in the ruin. One appears to be a Kong-Fu Master, another
person looks like a Sword Master. The Kong-Fu Master sees Thor and others.

KF Master: What the... When did all these people arrive? How did they appear on
           the edge of the cliff out of nowhere? We didn't even notice...
S Master:  Ah! Are they enemies?
KF Master: Doesn't look like it... Let's go meet up with them.

The Kong-Fu Master and Sword Master approach.

Shelia:    Oh...? Someone else got here first...
Barnerd:   Are they enemies?
Hart:      No... there are only two of them... looks like they want to talk...
KF Master: Hi everybody. Why are you all in this desert? Are you here to study
           this ruin like us?
Thor:      Hey... Aren't you... Carlos! Unle Carlos!
KF Master: What? How do you know I am Carlos?
Thor:      Uncle Carlos! It's me, Thor! You came and visited many times when I
           was little. You used to play with us and taught us Martial Art...
Alex:      Yeah, I remember you too, Uncle Carlos!
Carlos:    You are... Prince Thor! and Alex... you must be son of Knight Balat!
           I haven't seen you two for years! I remember you two always practice
           fighting with each other... haha...
Alex:      Yeah! You remember us too! It has been a long time...
Thor:      Father told us you went away for adventure. We are all so jealous of
           you. It's unbelievable that I can meet you here!
Carlos:    Time has certainly passed by... You both have grown up so much...
           How is Reter... I mean... His Highness?
Thor:      Father and Mother are both well. But they also get tired of life in
           the palace once in a while... They probably can't wait to hear your
           adventures.
Jonah:     Ah! Here is another familiar face! Sword Master Lordsman! Guess you
           threw away your duty as National Defense General again and come off
           for your old hobby: studying anicent ruin!
Lordsman:  Jonah! Only old tool like you understand how I think! But... why are
           you here too?
Jonah:     I was gonna to ask... What is this place? We were teleported here by
           magic portal...
Lordsman:  Oh... that's hard to explain. We are within the desert of the very
           North-West of this land. This is a oasis, and I always find the ruin
           here interesting... So I asked this friend to come with me...
Carlos:    Yes. Recently a archeologist helped me understand an ancient scroll.
           I have been trying to find some of the ancient artifacts that are
           mentioned in that scroll...

Robots are teleported in the center of the ruin. One appears to be the leader.

Leader:   Intruders confirmed! Objection: Protect Flying Platform! Destroy all
          intruders!
Robots:   Objection confirmed! Start proceeding!
Lordsman: What are those things?
Carlos:   Those are the ancient robots the scroll has mentioned about. They are
          created to protect the buildings and equipments of the ancient ones
          and slay anyone intruders... There is no time to explain. Prepare for
          battles!
Thor:     I like the sound of that! Let's fight!

---Strategy---

This is your first encounter with robots enemies, and they are tough. However
this chapter will end as soon as you defeat the Robot Leader. But you don't
want to waste all the experience, do you? Also there are some really awesome
treasures in this chapter, make sure you grab them all! If Minnie didn't join
you in chapter 16 and you want Lordsman to join you now, then make sure you
defeat the Robot Leader and end the chapter before round 15. Or you can wait
until round 15 for the reinforcing robots and more experience.

However, I must warn you. The initial robots are tough foes, but still easy to
defeat. But the two reinforcing robots... the reinforcing robots in round 15
include three Laser Robots and three Raiding Robots, they have higher damage
and they can really hurt you. As for the second reinforcement... four Raiding
Robots who have MUCH higher damage, DON't let them near your spell casters!
Even if you are a Go Extreme player, go a little easy with the robots in the
second reinforcement. It's not as hard as beating Reed in chapter 6, but...

Anyway, you will smash the crap out of the Robot Leader:

---Dialogue---

Leader: Command System is not functioning... Objection terminated... Battle
        System shut down...

All remaining robots blow up. Everybody gathers on the rock in the ruin.

Carlos:   These robots are created by the ancient ones... They are certainly
          hard to fight. But luckly everyone here is quite capable so we can
          defeat them without any problems...
Lordsman: Yup... now the danger has passed we can take a look at this ruin...
Alex:     Uncle Carlos, you haven't told us what kind of secrets there are in
          this ruin?
Carlos:   This is what I found on the scroll: this huge rock is actually the
          flying machine by the ancients. It needs to be activated by the staff
          of Teleport, and it will eventually take the people who possess some
          item called the Key of the Sky to the legend city: Golden Castle!
Thor:     The Key of the Sky? It's right here with me!
Alex:     The Staff of Teleport is here as well! We were teleported here with
          its power.
Carlos:   Really...? That's incredible!
Jonah:    I have been thinking... the abnormal events happening on this land
          and the mysterious enemies... they all probably has something to do
          with the Golden Castle. From all the ancient documentaries: Golden
          Castle is always related with war, bloodshed, and disaster... That's
          why we have been going after this old legend...
Carlos:   Yes! This is something we need to find out! Prince Thor, since you
          have both of the ancient artifacts... Do you mind if I join you to
          see the end of this whole thing?
Thor:     Of course! With your help, we will have even less trouble defeating
          our enemies!
Alex:     Yes!
Jonah:    What about you, Lordsman? For a Sword Master like you, why not come
          with us? I am sure you want to fight for the land of Mara...

***Note***
Carlos will not join you if you don't have the Key of the Sky.
If Minnie didn't join your team in chapter 16, Lordsman will gladly accept the
invitation. If she is in your team:

Lordsman: I... ai... I think... I shouldn't join your team right now... Jonah,
          I will go back to my duty now... I wish you all the best of luck...
          Return home safety, everybody...
Minnie:   Ai... this is because of me...
Reed:     What is it?
Minnie:   It was a long time ago... Back then he was a elite knight in Royal
          Guard Squad, and I had just become a knight...
Reed:     Ah! I remember... you asked him...
Minnie:   That's right. I was young and not able to control my emotion. I told
          him how I felt right in front of the entire knight squad... I didn't
          know he was already married to the sister of his highness. What I did
          made Mr. Lordsman very embarrassed... Later he asked the king and to
          take upon the duty of National Border Defense General. He have always
          been staying away from me...
Reed:     I am sorry, Ms. Minnie...
Minnie:   I was very sad about what happened. I threw myself into the world of
          sword mastery ever after. That's why I left the Royal Knight Squad to
          the deep mountain... After all these years I have gotten over that
          feeling, but Mr. Lordsman still remembers the embarrassment I caused
          him. You can all imagine how much trouble I caused him...
Thor:     It's fine, Minnie. Don's feel bad for something you did in the past.
          It's all right Mr. Lordsman didn't join us. You are the replacement
          of him in the battle! Let the disappointment and sadness from the
          past dissolve within the battlefield!
Thor:     Thank you, Thor. I will remember what you said...
Hill:     I just tried something. There are some feedbacks from this rock after
          I tried some simple spells with this staff... I am going to try if
          this rock can really fly...
Shelia:   Of course! Come on! I can't wait!
Hill:     All right then... let's begin!
          Mirogear... Hiakain... Ye... Harona!

The rock shakes violently.

Thor: Huh? Earthquake?

The rock shakes again.

Thor: What the hell is this?
Hill: It's probably going to lift up! Everyone get prepared!

The rock finally lifts and flies into the sky.

Shelia:  Yeah! We are actually flying!
Bernard: This is amazing! The technology of the ancients is truely incredible!
Jonah:   The speed of the flight is very fast! Do you know the destination,
         Hill?
Hill:    Uh... I don't know... I just activated it with this staff. Right now
         i am not controlling its direction...
Alex:    But... we can't just keep flying like this, right?
Yoni:    Don't worry... This rock will arrive at a destination... It is decided
         long time ago...
Hill:    Ms. Yoni? Do you know anything about this flying rock?
Yoni:    I seem to remember something about it...
Thor:    If that's how it is, then we can relax a bit and see where it's going.
         I can't wait to see where it will take us.
Alex:    Yeah! This flying feeling is awesome!

---Go Extreme---

To tell the truth, all my characters are level 40 by now. So I use the entire
chapter to level up Carlos. Basically I heavily damage the robots using some
powerful spells, then let Carlos do the finishing blow. But you must be careful
about the second reinforcement, they have the power to kill Carlos in one round
which means the failure of this chapter. I forgot about the procedure, but by
the end of the chapter, Carlos is level 40.

---New Character Analyse---

Carlos
This is a very good character. Carlos joins as a level 20 Kong-Fu Master, he is
also the teacher of Carrie and Theodore. He has high damage, decent defense and
good magic defense. Carlos is one of the strong later-coming characters.
Carlos is already a Kong-Fu Master. He can't change class.

***Note***
Carlos is also a character in Flame Dragon 1 - The Seal of Demon God! He was a
very powerful character in Flame Dragon 1, in fact I still remember the time he
shined against the VERY hard final boss. Thor's father, Reter is the main
character while Alex's father, Balat is the knight who guards him. Carlos was
one of a reliable member in that team. And here is a little spoiler: Carlos
will appear one more time in Flame Dragon 2 Plus - Mark of Wind. He is the only
character appears in all three Flame Dragon games.

(21, 23): Feather of Wind [Hidden]

---Dialogue---

Thor and others are flying on the platform.

Thor:   This is boring... how long are we going to keep flying?
Jonah:  Amazing! We have flown through the entire North-West of the land in one
        day! Judging by the direction, we are going into the mountains at the
        border of Mara Land...
Hill:   Are you saying the Mountains of Demons? There are activiting volcanos
        there... I heard that is the place where demon race initially rised.
        Does this mean the demons are with our enemies as well?
Keynes: This isn't surprising. Demons always live in this burning and hellish
        environment and never interact with any other races... They may have
        something strang going on in there that nobody else knows...
Hart:   Hmm... someone are here to welcome us...

Four Arch-Demon appear.

Demon One:   What is this? A flying rock with people on it?
Demon Two:   Fool! That's probably a flying machine, those people are the
             passengers...
Demon Three: What are they doing? Do they want to break through this place and
             get to the Valley of Fire?
Demon Four:  His highness commanded us! Nothing is allowed to cross this area
             through land or air!
Demon One:   That means we must slay these people! Let's go!
Keynes:      Hey, they don't seem very friendly. They probably gonna attack!
Alex:        Fight under this condition? This will not be very easy for us...
Sarah:       Some of us can fly as well, we will hold down their attacks. You
             guys on foot can defeat them after we lure them close enough.
Thor:        They are just something with two extra wings. What are we afraid
             of? Attack!

---Strategy---

This isn't a easy chapter for normal player. The enemies will keep coming from
four directions. There are spell casters, warriors, and knights. They can ALL
fly, so they have really good mobility which is quite a headache for you. All
I can say is: protect your weak characters well, calculate how long can they
move, check if you are within the range of their spells. This chapter is very
rewarding too. Every single enemy has something after being slain. It could be
some gold, good equipment, some medicine, and best of all, there are some very
rare elixirs as well. So enjoy that and kick their butts:

---Dialogue---

Jonah: It seems that they are commanded to guard this area and let nobody pass.
       Something must be happening within the Mountains of Demon. We should be
       prepared... anything can be down there...
Hill:  Hey Jonah... Our altitude starts dropping...
Sarah: Yeah... and it's getting faster...

The rock is quickly descending

Shelia: Ahh... Thor, this is kind of scary...
Thor:   It's ok, grab my hand. Yoni, you too...
Yoni:   ...ok
Lorna:  Oh... Alex, I am getting really dizzy...
Alex:   It's ok... come here...
Lorna:  Thanks...
Hill:   Hey Jonah old man. Girls are much more daring nowadays... This kind of
        situation can still be used for being romantic. We are way behind the
        times...
Jonah:  Hill... If you don't want these daring girls kicking you off this rock,
        you'd better stop saying anything until landing...

---Go Extreme---

Well, I did nothing beside let my characters eat some spell and level up Hill.
Now my Go Extreme team has completed, there are 21 characters in total have
reached level 40, they are:
Thor     as Hero
Alex     as Dragon Knight
Yoni     as Summoner
Gaia     as Robot (level 99)
Harold   as Berserker
Shelia   as Markswoman

Dragon Swordsmen led by the king of dragons, Lucas are in battle with dark
enemies who are led by a unknown being.

FireGod: Well done, king of dragons. You have finally found this place.
Lucas:   How dare you use the demon race to satisfy your own purpose!? This is
         absolutely unforgivable!
FireGod: Demon race is created by us! It's our own decision about how we use
         them! Since you found out what you want, you don't have to leave...
Lucas:   My reinforcement will arrive right away! Today you will see the true
         strength of dragon warriors!

Huge earthquake.

FireGod: What the... what kind of reinforcement do you have?
Lucas:   This isn't...

The flying platform lands.

Thor:    Finally, we landed...
Hart:    Geez! The ancients should have improved the landing technique... This
         rock can make you half-dead before a battle...
Thor:    Yoni! Yoni! Are you all right?
Yoni:    I'm fine... how about you, Thor?
Shelia:  Hum...
Jonah:   Clam down guys... This is the enemies' base, let's take a look...
Keynes:  Hey! There are someone over there fighting with the enemies already...
         and they are dragon warriors!
Bernard: Really!? Then his highness must be there! King Lucas!
Lucas:   Who are calling me... Bernard! Keynes!
Keynes:  Your highness! I have finally found you!
Jonah:   St. Lucas! It's been a long while! I didn't think I can meet you here!
Lucas:   Jonah! You are here as well! And you brought them with you! Perfect!
         We can win this battle now!
FireGod: Hum! Your reinforcement has arrived alright. But it will not make any
         difference! Die!
Thor:    Another weird looking thing with big words! Alex, let's take him down!
Alex:    Yes! Let him go meet with his three other friends!
FireGod: What! You have defeated Rock Demon, Ice Goddess, and Wind Lord! Damn
         it! I, the Fire God will take revenge for them!
Thor:    Then come and get me!

---Strategy---

Your enemies are mostly the demon warriors, knights, and witches. They all have
flight ability. This is the chapter that will make you feel glad for having
Dragon Knight class characters. Watch out for the demon witches, they cast use
the most dangerous spell: Reaper Toll! Seriously! Be careful. Few rounds later
the true reinforcement of Lucas will arrive:

---Dialogue---

Another group of Dragon Swordsmen arrives.

Dragons: Forgive us, your highness. We are late!
Lucas:   That's all right. Let's defeat this Fire God together!
Dragons: Roger!

---Strategy---

The enemies will slowly attack you. As you push forward to Fire God, be careful
with the four Hell Knights beside Fire God. Fire God himself can cast the most
powerful fire spell: Heaven Fire. So have your healing characters ready.

Make sure you don't forget to teleport Thor below the sword at the very top of
the map. Use Marlene, Yoni, or Hill with Staff of Teleport. Let Thor rest in
each round, a dragon will appear and fight with Thor. After Thor kills that
Dragon, he will receive the godly weapon: Sword of Flame Dragon!

Anyway, beat down the last weird looking monster, Fire God:

---Dialogue---

FireGod: Damned mortals... My master will prevail when the time of judgement
         comes... on that inevitable day, your kinds and your world will be
         purged...

After all enemies are killed.

Lucas: John, where did you find all these people? I have never seen such group
       of powerful warriors... The result of this battle may be different if it
       was for them...
Jonah: These are people with righteous hearts and desire. Our pathes have
       crossed by fate, and together we will challenge the dark force that is
       threatening the Land of Mara and fight to the end.
Lucas: Great! I was just worrying about not having enough powerful warriors...
       I have done my searching! This cave will lead to a building left by the
       ancients, there we will find a way getting us into the Golden Castle!
Thor:  The Golden Castle... Is that the very source of our enemies?
Jonah: We will have to go find out ourselves.
Lucas: The enemies don't want us near there... That Fire God was trying to
       activate the volcanos and destroy the path, but that way the homeland of
       demons will be destroyed as well... Thank god you guys arrived on time
       and stopped him.
Alex:  Great! Let's go to the ruin then! We must hurry before our enemies make
       their move!

A demon enters.

Demon:  Wait!
Thor:   Oh... Enemy?
Demon:  No! I came to join you!
Jonah:  You can speak human language? This is interesting...
Demon:  I am brother of the king of demon Kargen, I am Arch-mage Archie. I have
        studied a lot over the years, so I understand your language...
Alex:   Your race was just attacking us with Fire God. Why do you want to join
        us now?
Archie: We don't want to be your foes. But my brother was mind-controlled by
        the enemy and commanded the warriors to attack you. I see throught it
        and the enemy imprisoned me.... Thank you for stopping the volcanos and
        saving our home from destruction...
Jonah:  I see... how much do you know about the enemy?
Archie: They are absolutely related with the ancients and the Golden Castle!
        All of them were coming from the ruin... We must hurry to the ruin to
        stop them from gaining more reinforcement!
Keynes: Perfect! Can you lead the way then?
Archie: Of course... follow me.

---Go Extreme---

I didn't bother with Go Extreme since I have completed my PERFECT team. But if
you want, you can use Fire God's spell to level up your healing characters, and
leave some enemy warriors for torture.

---New Character Analyse---

Lucas
Truth to be told, he is a very decent character. But he joins you way too late.
For normal player, Lucas is still a good choice. However for Go Extreme player,
nobody has the effort to level him from 18 to 40 in the next few levels.
Lucas is already a Dragon Sword Master. He will not change class.

Archie
I can't say he is useful. He has low damage, low defense, so so magic defense,
and low life. His spells are also useless, I hate to break it to people like
this character: but he sucks. He is required to be present in chapter 26.
Archie is a Arch-Mage. He can't change his class.

---Dialogue---

Thor and others enter.

Alex:   This corridor is really weird... it's unlike anything we have seen...
Archie: This corridor is created by the ancients. All kings of demon forbid
        anyone from entering this place... We believe stepping into this
        corridor will bring disasters and misfortune to us...
Lucas:  I feel the misfortune is right in front ... What are these doll-looking
        things?

Large group of enemies and robots led by one robot.

Leader: Intruders confirmed! Objection: Eliminate potential threat! Mission
        confirmed: Destroy all intruders.
Robots: Mission confirmed. Proceeding battle strategy...
Lucas:  What are those?
Thor:   These are the machines built by the ancients to defend their ruin... No
        time to talk, let's destroy them!
Shelia: They are coming!
Jonah:  The enemies are many, take care, guys...

---Strategy---

I am kind of lazy to tell you guys what do. The enemies will attack group after
group, and there are constant reinforcement until round 16. So stay in good
formation and fight them off. Once again watch out for the Reaper Toll spell
from the enemy Demon Witches, also they can cast Earth Crack which can hit very
far.

If you grabbed the Control Center in Chapter 17, then put it on Gaia. Let Gaia
walk below the lying robot and rest at the buttom of the map:

---Dialogue---

Gaia: This robot isn't functioning... Hmm... his head is open, let me put this
      in... Uh...

The robot starts moving.

Robot: System startup... Standby for instruction code...
Yoni:  I see... 01E0C244-FE2C51932.
Robot: Confirmed... Master, I am 01279943 - Wood. Your order?
Yoni:  Why do I know this...? Anyway, help us destroy these robots.
Wood:  Confirmed... Reset system data... Complete... Proceeding now...
Yoni:  Unload level one battle mode after completion of this mission. Confirm
       with friendly target and remain in standby mode for further instruction.
Wood:  Confirmed.
Thor:  What are you doing, Yoni?
Yoni:  Nothing... I turned this robot against them...
Alex:  Whoa! You can do that?

---Strategy---

Push forward to Robot Leader. Don't forget to pick one of the five treasures
behind him. Smash the Robot Leader to pieces:

---Dialogue---

Leader: System damage... Impossible to repair... System shut down...

After all enemies are destroyed.

Archie: Perfect! We have broken through the defense squad! Now we can move
        forward... Hmm? Why is there a robot with us?
Thor:   Yoni turned this robot with us. She is always so good with this kind of
        things.
Alex:   Yeah. She brought Gaia with her when we met.
Archie: Really? Ms. Yoni, it seems that you know the code of these robots...
        right?
Yoni:   Ah? Code? I don't know...
Archie: No? Ms. Yoni, I am sure you know! Where did you come from? I know you
        aren't normal human! For all of us, please tell us who you are!
Yoni:   No! Stop speaking! I don't know anything...

Yoni runs behind Thor.

Thor:  That's enough! Archie! If you ever hurt Yoni, you will have to answer to
       my sword!
Jonah: Stop asking her, Archie... We can ask that robot, can't we? Uh... hey?
Wood:  01279943 - Wood. Confirmed.
Jonah: Wood? Can you answer my questions?
Wood:  Confirmed. Memory... Connected. Data... Loaded. Please ask.
Jonah: Where did you and other robots come from? Who is your master?
Wood:  Searching database... Record #73324: Unit 01279943 - Wood, Number Six
       Raiding Division, Third Squad. Manufactured by First Sky Fortress,
       transported to ground level for Battle Plan Seven. Our master is the
       mighty creator. He can create any robots and livings by his will. He is
       the dominator of this land. His name isn't in my database.
Jonah: Interesting... Why do the robots attack this land?
Wood:  Searching database... Record #2074213: Number six Raiding Division is to
       perform Battle Plan Seven. Objection: exterminate any living within Area
       X-07 to prevent enemies from entering Transporting Platform. Last record
       indicates: 01279943 - Wood ejected his Control Center due to technical
       accident.
Hill:  This is really hard to understand... Jonah, how much do you get?
Jonah: I only know Wood didn't attack us with other robots. But the root of the
       problems seem to lie in the First Sky Fortress he mentioned. And that is
       probably the Golden Castle, a fortress in this air, built by the
       ancients, with the ability of creating robots and other things...
Lucas: But didn't all ancients have died off in the war 30 thousands years ago?
       Why is this fortress launching an attack all of sudden?
Thor:  Maybe the Golden Castle is controlled by some robots as well. They
       didn't receive order of termination, so they are continuing some battle
       plans...
Reed:  Very possible. The ancients created this fortress for war and battles.
       But the war has ended 30 millenniums ago, why are they activated now?
Jonah: We will have to make a trip to the Golden Castle to find out... Wood,
       where is the Transporting Platform you mentioned?
Wood:  At the exit of this corridor.
Thor:  Good! Then let's go then! Yoni, follow me!
Yoni:  ...
Thor:  What happened, Yoni? Did I scare you? I am sorry...
Yoni:  No, Thor... I am... confused... who am I... All these things... how are
       they related to me...? I don't know... I am afraid that I may bring
       misfortune to you... I... maybe you shouldn't have even saved me back
       then...
Thor:  Yoni! I trust you! We are not scared as long as we are together! Come
       on! We have already come this far!
Yoni:  But... but...
Thor:  Forget about the past. Let's go... to the future... together!

Thor and Yoni goes ahead.

Hill:   Archie isn't so wrong... are you sure this is all right?
Jonah:  I see something special about this young man... We have to respect his
        dicision... Let's go with him...
Archie: Yeah...

***Note***
The dialogues will be different if you don't have Wood joining you. But the
result will be pretty much the same.

---Go Extreme---

You can Go Extreme in this chapter if you want. But the game is reaching its
end, and you should have most of the characters at level 40 already. This is
the last section of Go Extreme. From now on, it's time to enjoy the result of
Go Extreme.

---New Character Analyse---

Wood
Last character joins your team. He is a robot as well, just like Gaia. He can
level up all the way to 99, which is quite neat. But... it's too late! I don't
have to patience to level him to 99 from 50. Use him base on your choice.
Wood is a robot, he can't change class.

Thor and others enter.

Thor: Is this place the ancient ruin? Quite a weird place...
Alex: It's not just weird, it also has lots of enemies for us. Let's prepare
      for battle!
Hill: The platform is the middle is probably the Transporting Platform. We will
      see if the Key of the Sky work...

Robots notice Thor and others.

Leader: Intruders detected. Prepare for Battle Plan Six.

A pillar of light falls on Yoni.

Yoni:  Ah!!!!!
Thor:  Yoni! How dare you hurt her! I will destory these machines!
Robot: Defense Control Unit ASR-07, confirmed. Database connection complete.
       Initialize checking and repairing procedure.
Yoni:  Ah... my head... I feel I am gonna explode...
Thor:  Yoni!
Robot: Database repaired. All system normal. ASR-07, please return to your
       original mission. Over.
Yoni:  I... I... why...
Thor:  Yoni! Yoni! Are you all right...? Why are you crying?
Yoni:  Thor, don't worry about me... We have to defeat these robots...
       Everything else can wait...
Robot: ASR-07, you are showing hostility. You are one of the Centre Control
       Unit. You can't show hostility toward us.
Robot: Emergency! Reaction of ASR-07 abnormal! Connecting highest controlling
       Unit for solution...
Yoni:  The enemies are here... We have to attack...
Thor:  Yes! What are we waiting for? Everyone, attack!
Alex:  The answer to all questions is right here!

---Strategy---

The enemies are all robots. A new enemy is here: Beam Cannon. This thing can
shoot a straight line and do 450 magic damage to everyone on the path. It has
incredibly long range, so be very careful here. Your goal is to destroy the
three Robot Commanders. The Cannon can only shoot straight. So use spells or
characters like Knights, Archers with range attack to smash those Cannon. After
you destroyed two Robot Commanders, enemy reinforcement will arrive. But hurry
up and crush the third one:

---Dialogue---

Leader: Warning! Mission Terminated. ASR-07 action is abnormal...

All robots blow up. Everyone gathers on the platform.

Yoni:  This is the Transporting Platform. Haven't see something like this for a
       long time...
Thor:  Yoni... are you all right?
Yoni:  Thor, I have remembered everything from the past. Forgive me for lying
       to you... because I didn't know anything back then...
Thor:  Yoni! I don't blame you for anything... All I want to do is taking you
       home... that's all... trust me.
Yoni:  Yes... my home is up there... do you want to come with me?
Thor:  Of course! This is what I said I would do!
Hill:  Be careful, Thor. She became very... strange. She may be a member of our
       enemy in the first place...
Yoni:  Elder Jonah, Elder Hill. Your enemy is right on the other side of this
       Translating Platform, in the place you called Golden Castle. If you want
       to help us, then follow me. Thor and I will go... what do you think?
Jonah: Ms. Yoni? Is your memory back?
Yoni:  Yes... After the impact from that robot, all the damage of my memory was
       restored... They thought I would return to them, but thankfully... The
       memory of the past days with you guys was not erased... I am no longer
       who I was...
Jonah: Why, Ms. Yoni... I know you are not from our world... But how could you
       do this for us...
Yoni:  I did it for a much more selfish reason... I did it for someone who
       cares about me, looks after me, and protects me... Things like us are
       sadness, we have everything human being has... but we can't have the any
       emotions... That's why this is so important to me... I will not allow
       the one without emotions to harm him and the world he loves...
Jonah: I understand... I am so glad you are with us all along... We will not
       let you and Thor face the final enemy alone... We are coming with you!
Yoni:  Thank you, Mr. Jonah...
Thor:  What are you saying, Yoni?
Yoni:  Thor... I will let you know everything you want to know on the Golden
       Castle... But don't ask me anything until then... ok?
Thor:  Of course! I was just... forget I even said it.
Jonah: All right! Everything is prepared! We will face our final enemy! Yoni,
       please activate the Transporting Platform.
Yoni:  Yes... Thor, please hand me the Key of the Sky... Everyone, stand on the
       platform.
Thor:  Here you go.
Yoni:  Thanks... everyone gets ready...

Yoni walks to the pillars.

Yoni: 01327--344621073... Code installed. First Sky Fortess, Barrier disabled.
      Activating in 5 seconds.

The platform flashs.

Thor: Whoa... ah...

The platform flashs couple more times. Everyone is teleported.

***Note***
If you don't have the Key of the Sky right now. Yoni will go back to Golden
Castle alone, and she will sacrifice to bring destruction to the Golden Castle.
The legends and mysteries of this battle fortress will remain undiscovered
forever. The game will end with a Bad Ending!

Everyone is teleported into the Golden Castle

Thor:  Is this the Golden Castle? What a strange building... It doesn't look
       like a fortress at all...
Alex:  This place is built completely out of alloy and metal. Judging by the
       clouds around us... we are at a very high altitude.
Yoni:  This is where they transport robots on ground. From here we can enter
       the inside of the castle.
Jonah: The ancients must have a very advanced technology and culture. This
       design of structure and forging are way beyond the ability of our
       technology and magic...
Hill:  I wish I have time to study this place...
Yoni:  Too bad, I don't think we have any time. That guy may launch the Flame
       of Darkness anytime... We must find him fast!

Robot: Transfering complete. Commence operation.


---Strategy---

Simple enough, in the first 4 rounds, enemies will keep coming. Just fight your
way into them. Don't forget to stay away from Beam Cannon's range. Win this
battle by defeating two Robot Commanders:

---Dialogue---

Commander: System damage... Restoration impossible... shut down...

All robots blow up.

Yoni:  Is everyone all right. We have to keep moving. Or else more robots will
       keep coming...
Jonah: Where are we going next?
Yoni:  The Command Center of Golden Castle. We have to gain control of this
       fortress. This way I will be able to disable the robots.
Thor:  Don't really understand. But we will come with you.
Yoni:  Hehe... I don't expected you to understand. Come on, follow me...

---Dialogue---

Everyone enters

Thor:  Phew... we took so many turns... I feel a little dizzy...
Yoni:  Yes. But we have to avoid unnecessary battles to preserve our stamina.
       We had to go around the major patrol robots...
Jonah: Hmm... This place contains incredible energy... This is something I have
       never feel before...
Yoni:  Yeah... This place is the center of Golden Castle: Subatom Reactor. This
       device generate power for the entire fortress, also it can be turned
       into the ultimate weapon with minor modifications...
Baker: So what are we doing? Destroy it?
Yoni:  No! We don't have to destroy it. We are at the north of the reactor, the
       Control Center of this castle. With the Key of the Sky, I will be able
       to connect to the Centre System, thus gain control of the entire Golden
       Castle.
Thor:  Yoni, I can't believe you can do all these things... I really admire
       you!
Yoni:  Really? But the cost for this ability is too much... Never mind... Let's
       go...

Robots phase in.

Commander: Targets confirmed. Loading battle strategy. Complete. Battle system
           online. All units, confirm and destroy all targets. Include ASR-07.
Alex:      Hmm... enemies...
Thor:      Landform is a little bad for us... But winning is still not a
           problem.
Yoni:      This place is under enemies' control. Don't let your guard down,
           guys. Just help me get to the Control Panel, as long as I install
           the Key of the Sky, these robots will become nothing to us.
Thor:      No problem. Move out!
Alex:      Yeah, let's go!

---Strategy---

There are no new enemies in this chapter. All you have to do is pushing forward
and eventually getting Yoni right in front of the pillar behind all enemies.
There are six Beam Cannons forming a fire power net. Watch your step as you are
fighting them. Let Yoni walk in front of the pillar with the Key of the SKy:

---Dialogue---

Yoni: Right here... Syste code 0370425188... This is it...
Thor: How is it, Yoni?
Yoni: It may take a while for me to disable the security system... I need some
      time...
Thor: No problem! Be careful yourself...
Yoni: Yeah!

---Strategy---

I suggest you clearing all enemies before Yoni starts her operation. Because as
long as Yoni starts, you can not save for four rounds. During these rounds, two
Laser Robots, two Infantry Robots, two Raiding Robots, and at last two Robot
Commanders will phase in and attack. Place your characters in good position and
fight them off. After these four rounds:

---Dialogue---

Yoni: Weird! The Centre System is resisting my command... Someone has toyed
      with the database here!
Thor: What happened, Yoni?
Yoni: Ah... Final Defense System is launching... This is...

The entire place flashs.

System: Warning! Intruders in Centre System!

Everything flashs again.

System: Final Defense System launched!

Everything flashs again.

System: System locked up! Target confirmed! Proceeding battle strategy!

Everything flashs again.

Thor: Yoni! These three dragons...
Yoni: I guess this is the only way... Guys! These three dragons are the defense
      for the Centre System of Golden Castle. Due to interference of the enemy,
      I can't gain control of it... We have to destory them together!
Hart: How? Smash it with our weapons?
Yoni: Yes! Direct attack will be fine... But they are equipped with incredible
      power. Be careful!
Alex: Understand! Let's go!

---Strategy---

Fight three dragons at once! This is crazy! Not really, because although there
are three dragons, only one of them will attack in each round. The red dragon
will cast Heaven Fire, the blue dragon will cast God's Thunder, the grey dragon
will cast Reaper Toll. Get your strong characters up there and kick the dragon
butts:

---Dialogue---

Thor:  There!
Yoni:  Great! The Contre System is shut down. We didn't gain control of the
       castle, but there will not be any robot forces attacking us. Thank you,
       everyone. All we have to do now is control the rest of the system, then
       we can prevent the enemy from using the ultimate weapon...
Alex:  Perfect! So what are we doing next?
Yoni:  Find the final enemy! He was the one pulling strings behind the curtain
       all along. He is...
Being: Are you talking about me?

A being appears. He looks like a human just like Yoni, dressed in black.

Yoni:   It's you! It IS you!
Being:  ASR-07... How much damage did your system sustain that You would betray
        your own kinds? No mater... Thank you for bringing back this crystal
        chip... or you can call it the Key of the Sky... now the Flame of
        Darkness can be used again!
Yoni:   Why are you insisting on this crazy plan?</pre><pre id="faqspan-5">
Being:  Why are these mortals so important? The order we received is to destroy
        them all...
Yoni:   But we also received the terminating order! The Flame of Darkness is
        cancelled!
Being:  Yes! Terminated! But not cancelled! Those people commanded us to carry
        out this battle, meanwhile they escaped into outer space, leaving us
        with this cursed planet! Think about it! How long have we been waiting?
Yoni:   ASR-06... Your system is critically damaged. You never attended to
        repair your database since the last accident...
ASR-06: No need! My mission is the carrying out the battle plan! Now it's time
        to fulfill my goal...
Yoni:   Not possible! I have made a connection with the Centre System, this
        entire fortress is under my control!
ASR-06: Don't be foolish! We are at the same rank, but I am the one appointed
        for battle strategy. I have higher priority in the system when it comes
        to battle! Even when you are controlling the Centre System, the
        computer still accepts my commands!
Yoni:   You...
ASR-06: Flame of Darkness! System Online! Launch in 30 seconds! Target: Land of
        Mara! Hahaha! I have been waiting for this moment for so long!

The entire Golden Castle shakes due to the power of the ultimate weapon.

Yoni: Very well... It has come to this... You leave me no choice...

The Golden Castle suddenly shakes more voilently.

ASR-06: What are you doing? You can't stop me... No! No! You can't do this!
Yoni:   You have launched the Flame of Darkness. I will alter the Subatom
        Reactor into error zone! When too much energy is built up, space
        distortion will occour! We will all go into the endless darkness
        forever!
ASR-06: If you do this... These mortals with you will not survive!
Yoni:   A even bigger tragedy will happen if Flame of Darkness falls on Land of
        Mara! This is to protect the world everyone cares so much about! I
        believe... they will understand and forgive me!
Jonah:  Well done, Yoni! Doesn't matter happened! We will never compromise with
        the dark enemy!
Hart:   We have lived our lives and prepared for the worst... It's just too bad
        these young kids have to make this sacrifice as well...
Alex:   Our names will be told in legends and stories on the Land of Mara and
        Lotoria! As a warrior, this is the highest honour there is! This is our
        destiny!
Yoni:   I'm sorry... If I didn't take everyone to this castle... This may not
        happen...
Thor:   Yoni, I always trust you! This is all this weird looking guy's fault
        Hum! Let me give him some taste of my sword first!
ASR-06: Fool! Do it if you wish to die earlier!

The Golden Castle shakes and flashs in randomly.

ASR-06: System overload!

The fortress flashs, explosion occurs.

---Dialogue---

The castle is critically damaged after the explosion.
Thor and others survives the explosion.

Alex:  Oh... We are still alive?
Jonah: What a blast! But so far everything seems... still normal...
Thor:  Hey! What happened?

ASR-06 is standing on the other side.

ASR-06: Hum! We are all quite lucky... The Subatom Reactor didn't completely go
        into the error zone... Although the energy built up caused an explosion
        and partial space distortion. But these are just temporary... Hehehe...
Yoni:   ASR-06! We are lucky to be even alive! You still...?
ASR-06: ASR-07... My beautiful plan was almost destroyed by your hand! I will
        not make the same mistake... Now I will send you and these mortals all
        to hell! Then I will restart everything I did!
Thor:   Chastisable fool! Even now you still want to destroy our home! You are
        REALLY pissing me off... I will kill you right here! right now!
Alex:   Come on! Everyone! Time to defeat our ultimate enemy!
ASR-06: Hehehe... Foolish mortals... Come! My warriors!

Rock Demon, Ice Goddess, Wind Lord, and Fire God appear beside ASR-06.

Alex:   Hmm? Didn't we defeat all these monsters...? Why are they here again?
ASR-06: ASR-07, I have been spending a lot time on composing new beings. These
        are my masterpieces! They are just something I created, once destroyed,
        may be created again... These are the new version, they will not lose
        to you!
Yoni:   Hum! Wait...
ASR-06: Huh? You have some last words?
Yoni:   As the two Center Units of First Sky Fortress, we are supposed to be
        cooperating for a common goal. It's too bad we have to fight to death
        today... There is no point in hiding... Now you will see the true power
        of the Centre Supervising Unit of Golden Castle!

Yoni casts unknown spell.

Alex:       Oh? The wounds from the last battle are all healed.
Hill:       Ah... I feel my entire body is filled with energy...
ASR-06:     Huh! I didn't know you have this kind of power... But it will only
            allow these mortals to last a bit longer... The final victory is
            still mine!
Thor:       Shut your mouth and come fight me!
ASR-06:     Symbol of the earth! Go and show these mortals the power of
            the creator!
Rock Demon: Yes, master!

Rock Demon teleports in.

---Strategy---

The final battle begins! Make good formation of your team. Comes with the Rock
Demon, there are two robot commanders as well. But you can take them all! The
Rock Demon has high damage, he can cast Earth Crack which hit very far. Beside
that there is nothing to be worried about, kick his butt:

---Dialogue---

ASR-06:      Goddess of water! Seal them into the eternal prison of ice!
Ice Goddess: Yes, master!

Ice Goddess teleports in.

---Strategy---

She can still cast God's Favour, also Offense and Defense to strengthen herself
and the two robot commanders. She is rather easy to pick on:

---Dialogue---

ASR-06:    Voice of the wind! Turn them into mists of blood with your blade!
Wind Lord: Yes, master!

Wind Lord teleports in.

---Strategy---

There is nothing new about this guy, just beat him to the ground:

---Dialogue---

ASR-06:   God of fire! Light your hell fire! Burn them into dusts!
Fire God: Yes, master!

Fire God teleports in.

---Strategy---

Same old stuffs. But after killing Fire God, organize your formation and heal
everyone. It's the best for you to have Yoni use Lord of Destruction now. Kill
the Fire God:

---Dialogue---

ASR-06: Foolish mortals... You have at last chosen your dominator to be the the
        punisher! Very well! Mortals that dare to challeng your god... Prepare
        for the final judgement!

ASR-06, the Sky Master teleports in.

---Strategy---

Truth to be told, he is not that hard. Sky Master can use Heaven Fire and God's
Thunder, they are powerful spells, but not deadly. His damage is just decent,
one or two good melee characters will handle him well. He has quite a long life
though, so take your time.

---Dialogue---

ASR-06: No! This can not be! I am the creator and dominator... I can not be
        defeated by mortal! No!

Everyone gathers together in front of Yoni.

Yoni:  It's over. This mistake is finally corrected... it is all past now...
Thor:  We finally win this battle! This is... great! Yoni!
Jonah: I am glad we have accomplished our mission... But as a scholar, I still
       wish to know how everything started... Ms. Yoni, can you tell me?
Yoni:  I will make it simple. This fortress, robots, the Sky Master, and I are
       all created by the ancients... The demon is also a race created by the
       ancient to use as a weapon... At that time, the ancients are fighting
       wars and battles. They created countless deadly weapons. This fortress
       is one of them...
Hill:  Are you talking about the legendary Judgement Day? It says that war has
       destroyed everything in this world, it took millenniums for things to go
       back to normal...
Yoni:  Yes... Both side kept using different weapons to destroy the other side
       ... There are only a few ancient human escaped into the outer space, all
       other were killed... This battle fortress was built for pressuring the
       enemies on ground. Sky Master and I are both the Centre Control Units, I
       control the basic running of this castle, Sky Master, or ASR-06 is
       responsible for monitoring the ground and use of weapons. This fortress
       is run by both of us...
Jonah: It's quite hard to believe...
Yoni:  We were both human. However we were rebuilt and power operated. We can
       directly connect to machines and systems in this fortress. We can also
       prevent consenescence by dormancy. Logically our lives are eternal for
       the duty on this fortress...

Yoni takes a look around the fortress.

Yoni:  Before the last group of the ancients retreated this planet, we received
       the order of bombing the planet surface with ultimate weapon Flame of
       Darkness. However we received another weak signal of terminating right
       before launching... After that we didn't receive any other signals. So
       we have been paused like this, waiting for the next signal with this
       fortress... for 30 thousands years...
Thor:  30 thousands years...? Didn't you feel lonely...?
Yoni:  No. We were all in dormancy. The system would wake us up if there is a
       new signal... Our dormancy ended soon ago...
Jonah: How was the fortress awakened after all these years?
Yoni:  It was an accident of security system. It reported that the fortress was
       attacked. ASR-06 insisted on believing it was an attack from the livings
       on the ground, and he wanted to resume the Flame of Darkness... I
       disagreed with him because I discovered new lives on this land...
       Finally I decided to throw the most important component of the Flame of
       Darkness out to the ground... The war 30 millenniums ago had done
       enough, that tragedy should not repeat again... ASR-06 saw my intention.
       During the contention of that component, I accidently fell out of the
       fortress..
Alex:  So... You fell on Land of Lotoria?
Yoni:  My system was seriously damaged after the landing impact... I have
       forgotten everything... That's when my human nature take control again
       ... I asked you guys to take me home, so Thor and you came all the way
       here... This is probably the fate god prepared for us...
Jonah: This is absolutely unbelievable... It is probably like you said, god's
       decision... Now we have defeated the last enemy... Ms. Yoni, what do you
       intend to do?
Yoni:  I will teleport all of you back to your home, the Land of Mara. Then I
       will take this castle into another dimension. The Golden Castle will
       disappear from this world forever... Let this legend come to an end...
Thor:  Yoni? You are not coming with us...?
Yoni:  No... I am a part of this fortress... I must stay to prevent anything
       from happening again... It's time to say farewell... Everyone, the
       journey with you all has been... great... I will always keep this memory
       with me...
Thor:  Yoni! You really want to stay here?
Yoni:  Thor... I can't thank you enough... You kept your promise and took me
       home... You are something special for me... When my memory came back, I
       didn't know which side to choose... You... are the reason I made my
       decision...
Thor:  For me...?
Yoni:  Thor... I understand your feeling... But I am not just a girl... I don't
       belong to your world... Let me stay... This is... my duty...
Jonah: Thor, you must understand Yoni's position. There will be someone for you
       in the future... You are the prince of Lotoria. There is a wonderful
       path ahead of you... Don't let down Yoni's wish for you...
Thor:  I... I understand... Yoni... Take care...
Yoni:  Thank you... Thor... I will always remember you... in my life...

Yoni casts spell. Everyone is teleported back on Land of Mara.

Hart:   This is the mother earth of Mara! We are home again! Haha! You can feel
        the soft soil under your feet.
Lorna:  Ah... Soft wind... Warm sunshine... This is world we love...!
Jonah:  I am so glad we have accomplished our goal and saved our world. Well
        done! Everybody!
Shelia: I will ask father to make a BIG party! We will celebrate for this! This
        is not something anyone can accomplish!
Lorna:  We can have some nice drinks together! What do you say, Alex?
Alex:   Uh... I am responsible for protecting the prince on the journey. Now
        everything is finished, I should return to Lotoria soon because... I
        don't want to have his highess and queen worrying...
Lorna:  But... Uh... Come on! Just stay for few days!
Shelia: Lorna, you can go to Lotoria with Alex! Wait for few days... I will go
        visit Lotoria myself! So... come with me!
Lorna:  Oh! That's great! Alex, see you then!
Alex:   Yes... great... Hehe...
Jonah:  Look at them... Haha... Don't you miss being young?
Sophia: Yeah! After achieving our victory, some celebration is necessary!
        Hmm...? Where is Thor?
Hill:   He was here one moment ago... There he is!

Thor is looking at the sky alone. Everybody walks beside him.

Alex:   What happened, Thor?
Thor:   Yoni... She is there... in the sky...
Shelia: Really? I don't see anything...

A shining sphere forms in the sky. Golden Castle appears.

Lorna: That is... the Golden Castle.
Jonah: The Golden Castle... A legendary city nobody has ever really seen...
Lucas: A city holds the stateliness of the sky... but also a city that can only
       bring death and destruction...

Yoni's voice speaks.

Yoni: Thor... Farewell... Take care of yourself...
Thor: It's her voice... Yoni...

Golden Castle flashs couple times, then disappears.

Baker: That was the last blessing of Yoni...

Thor and Alex look at the sky.

Thor: ...Thank you, Yoni... In the days to come... I will always remember you
      ... and this special journey... 
Alex: Everything is over... The legend of Golden Castle has ended...

 FAQs
======

Q: What level is the best to upgrade class?
A: 40 is the best. There are many reasons. A character can gain up to level 40,
   after changing class, the character will be back to level 1 and able to gain
   another 40 levels. That is 80 levels in total. However if you upgrade class
   at level 25, that means you lose 15 levels. For spell-casters, some spells
   can be learned only before class changing at level 35+. These spells include
   powerful and unique magic like Teleport, Vigor. The only expection is when
   your character is at level 39 at the end of one chapter and you really need
   to change class for him. As for me, I would wait even a character is level
   39 with 99 experience.

Q: How many characters are there in the game?
A: 31 in total. Only 30 of them can become part of the team. The walkthrough
   will cover the detail reasons.

Q: Is there an English version of this game?
A: Not as far as I know. This is the reason of me writing this walkthrough.

Q: Which class is better for Thor, Sword Master or Hero?
A: Let's compare:
   Sword Master: Decent damage, High defense, below average magic defense, have
                 the most powerful skill in the game: Dragon Strike.
   Hero: Scary damage, Scary defense, Scary magic defense, have some of the
         most powerful spells: Holy Bolts, God's Thunder, Heaven Fire, etc.
   I would choose Hero. But maybe you can choose Sword Master if you want some
   challenge or see the powerful Dragon Strike.

Q: How can get to the secret shops?
A: Check the walkthrough.

Q: Why Carrie didn't show up at chapter 7?
A: Check the walkthrough.

Q: How many characters can you use for each chapter?
A: You can use Thor + 15 other characters in normal chapters.
   You can use Thor + 19 other characters in secret chapters.

Q: Where can I download Flame Dragon 2?
A: I don't want to get into troubles... (Slowly back away...)
   (Pop back in) Go nuts with Internet.

Q: Where can I get Sword of Flame Dragon?
A: Wait for the walkthrough upgrades and give me some time to rest. lol

Q: Can you write walkthrough for Flame Dragon 1?
A: It's undeniable that Flame Dragon 1 is the beginning of FD legend, and it is
   a classic game. However I don't know enough information to write a complete
   walkthrough. In fact, no walkthrough for FD1 was ever written, not even in
   Chinese.

Q: Is there a Flame Dragon 3? can you write walkthrough for that?
A: No, there isn't Flame Dragon 3. But there is a Flame Dragon 2 - Mark of Wind
   which is quite another great game. I "can" write walkthrough for that, but
   I will decide if I am going to after finishing this current walkthrough.

Q: Do you get paid for writing this walkthrough?
A: No, and I don't care for it. Doing things voluntarily is different to doing
   things for money.
