(Game Introduction)
Announcing the 1995 King of Fighters Tournament.  The event will be conducted
as the previous one, and we welcome both old and new victims...er teams.
Break a spine. [R]

(The Kusanagi/Yagami Story)
        Beware the Purple Red Flames of the Yagami!  1800 years ago, the evil
Orochi Yamatano was silenced by the fists of Kusanagi, Hasshaku and the power
of Magatama.  In a bitter dispute, the Hasshaku family broke legion with the
Kusanagi clan.  660 years of battle followed.
        The Hasshakus, seeking domination and a life of earthly pleasure,
allied with the Orochi family in a blood contract, rising in terror under the
name of Yagami.
        Behind the scenes, the dreaded Yagami clan manipulated the power
holders of time, buffeting all good souls with winds of chaos.  In the
shadows of history, the Yagamis collided with the Kusanagis continuously.
And now, the final battle is set to take place......
        1995 Kyo and Iori meet to battle it out!

(Manual Ending)
Who is the mysterious organizer of the KING OF FIGHTERS?  Just what is the
identity of the Mysterious [R]?  And what enigmatic personage waits at the
end of the line.....? The solution to all these questions rests in your
hands!

OLD THINGS/NEW THINGS :

--> Characters that have returned : All but the USA Sports Heroes Team
--> Characters that are new : Iori Yagami, Eiji Kisaragi (AoF), Billy Cane
        (Fatal Fury), Saisyu Kusanagi (Kyo's Father)
--> The USA Sports Heroes Team is gone (most people are happy, and some are
        not).  But the new team has the USA stage.
--> There is now a dodge attack (some say it's in KoF'94 too, but I haven't
        been able to do it), CD is now a knockdown, BC is now the taunt, and
        there's a new shadow jump (if anyone knows what this is good for, let
        me know please).
--> There are now two bosses : Omega Rugal (yes, he's back) and Saisyu
        Kusanagi (and Kyo's dad is back too).  Saisyu is your first round
        opponent and Rugal is the second round opponent.  Both are usable
        with the code below.
--> There is an afterimage jump (still trying to figure out what it's for),
        which makes you jump faster and farther.
--> There is air juggling to a greater extent.  (It was limited in '94.)
--> There are chain combos.  (I've yet to find all of these and how it
        exactly works.)
--> Counter Attack : If your POW meter is full, you can perform a quick
        counter attack with a POW special or a regular special.
--> Guard Drops : There are now Guard Drops a la World Heroes Perfect.
--> And of course the best new thing : TEAM EDIT.  You can now choose your
        own combination of three!!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BLOOD CODE :

This is for the home systems : As in KoF'94, the code is the same.  Wait for
the high scores to appear, then press A & D on controller one and B & C on
controller two at the same time.  Then press start.  The blood and Mai's
bouncy...er...attributes should be back.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS CODE :

This works in both the arcade and home systems : At the team edit screen (you
can do this even if you don't use team edit, but you won't be able to play
the two bosses), the 15 second counter, press and hold start.  While holding
start, push up and B, right and C, left and A, and down and D.  The two
bosses should then appear on either side of the counter and the counter
should reset back to 15.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS :

A couple of bugs have been reported and I myself have run into these on
occasion.  Some moves performed while opponent is barely in range or as an
interrupt, can freeze up the opponent.  This has happened to me twice so
far, so it is possible.  To undo the freeze, just hit your opponent again (It
would be wisest to perform the POW special at this point.).  Another bug is
attacking an opponent who is in the process of performing a special move of
his own.  The attack you perform may go through the opponent and he will just
stand there until you try to hit him again.  There may be other bugs, but
these are the only two I know of that I myself have come across as well.

Notes : Their stage is King's bar.  On the left side, Duck King (Fatal Fury)
        and Heavy D (KoF'94) are playing cards.  The waitresses cheer if the
        female team wins and turn around and hold their heads in sorrow if
        they lose.  When King does her entrance pose and tosses her cup, you
        can hear it as it hits the floor in any stage.  Todo from AoF is also
        in the background behind Duck and Heavy.  If you look closely at the
        walls, especially around the center pillar (near the combined NeoGeo
        logo), you can see faces.  I can only make out Nakoruru's face on
        the center pillar.  I can see other faces, but can't tell whose they
        are.  On Mai's umbrella (in her win pose), the Kanji translates to
        "Nippon ichi!"  Ripper is in the back bar on the phone (most likely
        reporting in to Geese).

Notes : They take the old USA team's stage.  It's a chemical factory with the
        New York cityscape in the back.  Check out the gaseous foreground.
        An interesting note is that if the computer decides to do a team edit
        as well, this is the only team that will not be edited.  One of the
        buildings in the cityscape on the left is Geese's tower (the one with
        the most lights on).  This is the setting for the opening scene in
        Fatal Fury 3.

Notes : In the very back of the center of the stage, you can see 'KoF' on a
        sign.  Also, there's a monkey-like creature that follows the fight
        (he's the monkey on Terry's shoulder in the Fatal Fury 3 close up),
        cheering for the Fatal Fury team.  One of the two men in the center
        background looks a lot like Lawrence Blood (could it be him?).  When
        Terry's hat flies off, and when King tosses her handkerchief, they
        float to the left.  Also, in when King does her entrance pose and
        tosses her cup, you can hear it splash in the water.  Cool thing of
        note is when Terry does his Power Dunk, he turns his hat backwards.

        it's the chest area of the statue, and the third, the head.

Notes : Their stage is a stage in the old Ikari Warriors game.  When someone
        is knocked down or a powerful move is performed, rocks fall from the
        top of the screen.  It is also a scene (very brief) in the Fatal Fury
        Motion Picture.

Notes : Chang and Choi each have new moves, which are similar to one of Kim's
        moves.  Perhaps he really did teach them since '94.  More evidence of
        such is their stage is a campground with training equipment strewn
        all over.

Notes : Omega Rugal is either ressurected, possessed, or a cyborg.  It seems
        to be a combination of all three, but he really did die in '94.  His
        story is really strange.  He has a lot of female servants, in '94 had
        an aircraft carrier, and now his stage is the interior of a missle
        base.  Note the large missle in the back as you're moving up on the
        platform.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIAL MOVES ADDENDUM :

Air MAX specials for Robert, Kensou, & Mai (Ryo & Kim - same as on ground) :
        To perform their MAX special in the air, you must cancel from a
normal attack (after hit or guard) into the air MAX special.  Whether or not
this is a requirement is still unknown at this point.

Robert - vertical/normal jump strong kick, cancel :

        O   O       O  O  O

Kensou - vertical/normal jump weak punch or normal jump strong kick, cancel :

        |  \   -O  \   |   /  O-  -O  D then C  Shinryu TenbuKyaku
        O   O       O  O  O

Mai - she can do either her MAX or her Flying Dragon Blast :

1. vertical/normal jump weak punch/strong kick, cancel :

        -O  \   |   /  O-  -O  B then C         Super Deadly Ninja Bees
             O  O  O

(C must be pressed 3/60 sec after B is pressed; NOT at the same time)

2. don't know the condition :

        -O  \   |   /  O-  \   B then A         Flying Dragon Blast
             O  O  O        O

More than one fireball on screen :

Ryo :  |  \   -O  A  O-   /  |  \   -O  C
       O   O             O   O   O

       The second motion and button press must be done RIGHT as Ryo recovers
       from throwing the first fireball.  This also works for Rugal (A Kaiser
       Wave, C Reppuken).

Athena and King can have multiple projectiles on screen as well.  For Athena,
do the A Crystal Shoot after the MAX Special, then do a C Psycho Ball RIGHT
as you recover.  For King, do a B Double-Strike, then a B Venom Strike, JUST
as you recover, then do another B Double-Strike after you recover from the
Venom Strike, repeat...  (King can have 3 projectiles on screen.)

friends.  (The team.)  Benimaru : Ru..Rugal!  I knew it!  (Close up of Rugal)

power.  (Back to team.)  Benimaru : Kyo!  Don't be fooled -- he's brain-
washed!  Kyo : Rugal!  You monster!  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : A
touching reunion.  (Rugal's face.)  Saishu, kill them!
- (Kyo holding Saisyu.)  Kyo : Papa-san!  Saishu : Heh, Kyo.  My power wasn't
so great after all.  Kill him, Kyo.  Avenge me...!  (Angry Kyo.)  Kyo : Rugal
you slime!  (Rugal.)  Rugal : Heh, heh.  The defeated dog barks loudest!
(Raises hand.)  Taste my fury!  (Rugal powers up, shredding shirt.)  Rugal :
Wooooo...
- (Rugal holding bloody arm.)  Rugal : Even with my new power, I lost.
What?  My body.....?????  (Far shot of Rugal as light appears from above.)
(Close up on Rugal.)  Rugal : No...to meet such a fate!  But I'll be back...
you jerks!  (Light consumes Rugal.)  (Kyo and a puzzled Benimaru.)
Benimaru : What was that shade?!  Kyo : I don't believe it!  Benimaru : What?
Kyo : Ah, nothing.  Just......  (Benimaru and Daimon.)  Benimaru : Huh?  Kyo,
your father!  Daimon : Yeah, where did he go?  (Overhead view of the team.)
Kyo : I knew he wasn't dead.  He'll find his way home.  Benimaru : Yeah, I
guess you're right.  Kyo : Well, let's go back to Japan.  Benimaru, Daimon :
Yeah!  (Scrolls to cliff with Saisyu.)  (Close up on Saisyu.)  Saishu : Kyo,
you can't escape the Kusanagi fate.  We face a greater battle, soon to begin.
(Back to far view.)  Strengthen yourself, Kyo.  Good Luck!

ENGLAND : (Blackness) Mai : Hey, it's beauty mist!  (Team surrounded by gas.)
Yuri : It's gas, bimbo!  King : A trap?  Again?  (Fade to black.)  Yuri :
Where are we?  (Rugal in chair.)  Rugal : Pretty, even in the morning.
(Team.)  King : Rugal!  You're alive!  (Rugal's face.)  Rugal : Perceptive
as always!  But you must die!  A just dessert for hindering my evil plans!
(Team.)  Mai : Don't ya think that's too much.  I mean, death?  (Worm's eye
view of Rugal.)  Rugal : Charming to the last.  I wish I could do it myself.

engage in full contact.  (Team.)  Yuri : Hey, do you know Kyo?  Mai : Wow, he

view of Rugal.)  Rugal : "Beast"?  I like the ring to that.  (Close up on
face.)  Your mine, Kingy.  Kiss, kiss.

I'll be back...you jerks!  (Light consumes Rugal and skull appears.) (Yuri
and Mai's profile and shoulder of King.)  Mai : What just went on here?
(Move up to show King's profile.)  King : The power was too much.  Whose evil
shadow was that?  (Mai with hands up and Yuri and King on either side.)
Yuri : Well, everyone's all right, and we won.  We can live with that, right?
Mai : Yeah, that's right.  Let's party, hearty!  King : Yeah, back to the
club.  And drinks on the house!  Mai, Yuri : Yeah!  (Yuri and Mai at a table,
drunk.)  Mai : Hey, Andy!  Mai, Yuri : Kyaaah!  (King moves into view holding

where are we?  (Rugal in chair.)  Rugal : Wakey, wakey, sleepy heads!
(Team.) Billy : Rugal!  I knew you were behind this!  (Rugal's face.) Rugal :
Perceptive, to the last.  How about working for me?  (Team.)  Billy : Too bad
pal, I only have one boss!  Kisaragi : And I work only for me!  Yagami : I
hate being an employee, garlic breath!  Billy : Anyway, the answer's up
yours!  (Worm's eye view of Rugal in chair.)  Rugal : You sadden me.  I
thought you were smarter!  Very well.  I've no use for you.  (Saisyu.) (Close
up on face.)  Saishu : Saishu Kusanagi here.  Shall we mix it up?  (Team.)
Yagami : Saishu Kusanagi?  What brings you here?  (Saisyu.)  Saishu : How
you've grown from a snot-nosed kid.  (Team.)  Yagami : Don't push it, fossil
face!  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : Enough.  (Rugal's face.)  Dispose
of them.

lose.  (Rugal.)  Rugal : Heh, heh.  You did well! (Raises hand.)  But, now

(Light appears behind.)  What?  My body....?????  (Far shot of Rugal sur-
rounded by light, then close up.)  Rugal : No...to meet such a fate! (Iori's
face.)  Yagami : Only a the bloodline can control such power.  You hadn't a
chance.  (Rugal surrounded by light.)  Rugal : Is that so?  Dare you seize
this power?  I'll be back!  (Light consumes Rugal and skull appears.)  (Billy
and Kisaragi.)  Billy : What the...?  (Iori's head moves into view.)  Yagami:
What a fool!  Such power can only by mine!  Well, shall we wrap this up?
Kisaragi : What?  (Billy and Eiji bloody and beaten.)  Billy : Hey!  You're..
.you're Geese!  (Iori.)  Yagami : Just wait, Kyo.  You're next for extermin-
ation.  (Fade to black.)  You and all Kusanagis!  Yah, hah, hah!

Andy : Where is this?  (Rugal in chair.) Rugal : Long time, no see, my boys.
Sleep well?  (Team.)  Terry : Rugal!  You're alive!  (Rugal's face.)  Rugal :
Very much so.  But you're soon to see the end.  For ruining my plans, I take
your pathetic lives!  (Team.)  Joe : Don't flatter yourself.  I read you like
a book.  (Worm's eye view of Rugal in chair.)  Rugal : Predictable to the
last.  But first, meet my partner!  (Saisyu.)  (Close up on face.)  Saishu :
Saishu Kusanagi is the name.  Shall we flail away?  (Team.)  Terry :
Kusanagi?  Kyo's...?  Andy : Rugal.  You've brainwashed him!  (Worm's eye
view of Rugal.)  Rugal : In a word.  (Rugal's face.)  Now meet the legend and
his fists.
- (Saisyu sitting against wall, beaten.)  Saishu : My fate was to lose.  I'm
impressed.  (Rugal.)  Rugal : Heh, heh.  You did well, young ones.  (Raises

rounded by light, then close up.)  Rugal : No...to meet such a fate!  But
I'll be back, you jerks!  (Light consumes Rugal and skull appears.)  (Team
on top of cliff.)  Joe : What is going on here?!  Andy : He couldn't control
his power.  But whose evil shadow...?  Joe : It sure gave me a bad case of
goose bumps.  Terry : Worse than Geese and Krauser, I fear we'll be facing
it, too.  (Close up of the team.)  Andy : Terry...  Terry : Someday, that is.
Not now.  Maybe it's nothing to do with us.  Joe : Of course, we're no
heroes.  (The trio's hands on top of each other.)  Andy : Well, when the time
comes, we'll fight together.  Terry, Joe : Yeah.  The kings of fighters!
(Geese's office.)  I knew Billy would fail...  But next time, I'll be in
charge!  Later, Terry!  (Geese's face.)  Geese : Wah, hah, hah!

MEXICO : - (Blackness) Robert : What the?  (Team surrounded by gas.)  Ryo :
It's gas, samurai-head!  Takuma : Nuts!  To be trapped like...  (Fade to
black.)  Ryo : What in heavens?  (Rugal in chair.)  Rugal : Welcome, back, my
friends.  Sleep well?  (Team.)  Takuma : Rugal!  You're alive!  (Rugal's
face.)  Rugal : Perceptive as always.  Of course!  But you must die!  A just
dessert for hindering my evil plans!  (Back to team.)  Robert : Face Kyokugen
Karate's power, garlic breath!  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : Well,
you're in for a full course!  Meet the appetizer!  (Saisyu.)  (Close up of
face.)  Saishu : We meet again, Takuma!  (Back to team.)  Takuma : Saishu
Kusanagi.  How?  (Saisyu.)  Saishu : Resurrection!  Be warned!  Kusanagi
power fills me!  (Back to team.)  Takuma : Rugal, you fiend.  Snap out it
Kusanagi!  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : Hah, hah!  A touching re-
union!  (Close up of his face.)  Get on with the battle!
- (Saisyu sitting against wall, beaten.)  Saishu : My fate was to lose.  I'm
impressed.  (Rugal.)  Rugal : Heh, heh.  You did well.  (Raises hand.)  Now
you'll face evil's wrath!  (Powers up, shredding shirt.)  Rugal : Woooooo....
- (Rugal holding bloody arm.)  Rugal : Even with my new power, I lost.
(Light appears behind.)  What?  My body....?????  (Far shot of Rugal sur-
rounded by light, then close up.)  Rugal : No...to meet such a fate!  But
I'll be back...you jerks!  (Light consumes Rugal and skull appears.)  (Back
of Takuma with Robert and Ryo kneeling behind him.)  Robert : Just what is
going on here?  Takuma : Controlling such power just ate him up.  Where's
Kusanagi?  Ryo : Yeah, where did he...  Takuma : Saishu?  He couldn'tve (sic)
died from that.  Take care, Saishu...  Wherever you are.  (Robert and Ryo
with stunned look.)  By the way, it's time I left you two.  (Back to first
view.)  Ryo : What?  Robert : Huh?  Takuma : I'm just too old for this.  You
guys take over for me at the gym.  Robert : M-Master!  Takuma : Of course,
I'll have say in all decisions and train you two.  Ryo, Robert : What?
Robert : But master, it's no different than before!  Takuma : Oh yeah.  Well,
no matter.  Robert : I got a bad feeling about this.  Hey, let's team up with
Yuri.  Ryo : Good idea.  (Angry Takuma.)  Takuma : What are you gabbing
about.  It's training time!  (Robert holding head and Ryo with pained look.)
Ryo, Robert : Ah, I thought so!


CHINA : - (Blackness) Athena : Kyah!  What?  (Team choking on gas.)  Chin :
Oh no!  Gas!  Kensou : Uh oh!  A trap!  (Fade to black.)  Athena : Uh, where
are we?  (Rugal in chair.)  Rugal : Good morning, my heroes!  (Team.)  Chin :
Just as I thought, Rugal!  (Rugal's face.)  Rugal : Heh, heh.  That's right.
Now you must die!  For ruining my plans, death is my present to you.  (Team.)
Kensou : Why, you fiend!  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : Fiend?  Take
it easy, dudley!  And say "hi" to my henchman!  (Saisyu.)  (Close up on
face.)  Saishu : Heh, heh.  Nice to meet you.  Shall we mix it up?  (Team.)
Athena : Kusanagi?  Not Kyo's....  Chin : Wait, he's possessed with evil!
(Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : Hah, hah!  (Close up of face.)  Know my
power and eat the fists of legend!
- (Saisyu sitting against wall, beaten.)  Saishu : As I thought.  Oh, it's
over...!  (Rugal.)  Rugal : Hmm.  The only justice is total power!  (Raises
hand.)  Now I'll teach you that lesson!  (Powers up, shredding shirt.)
Rugal : Woooooo....
- (Rugal holding bloody arm.)  Rugal : Even with my new power, I lost.
(Light appears behind.)  What?  My body....?????  (Far shot of Rugal sur-
rounded by light, then close up.)  Rugal : No...to meet such a fate!  But
I'll be back...you jerks!  (Team.)  Athena : Don't count on it, slick!
(Rugal in light.)  Rugal : Humanity is destined for destruction.  I'll be
back! (Light consumes Rugal and skull appears.)  (Team on cliff.)  Kensou :
What happened?  Chin : Consumed by his own evil.  But what evil drove him to
such an end?  Athena : Are we really doomed, master?  Chin : We must fight
our own evil.  But doomed?  Nah!  Kensou : Master, things aren't really that
hopeless, right, Athena?  Athena : Yeah...right...heh.  Chin : Yes, you may
be correct.  Athena : Come on, let's go home.  (Close up of the team sitting
down on cliff.)  Kensou : Better still, let's eat!  I'm starving!  Athena :
Hee, hee.  Kensou, you'll never change, ya big lug!  (Kensou's expression
changes to a frown.)  Kensou : What does that mean?  Athena, Kensou, Chin :
Wah, hah, hah!

BRAZIL : - (Blackness) Ralf : What's that?  (Team choking on gas.)  Clark :
Oh no!  Gas!  Heidern : Can't...can't stay...awake...  (Fade to black.)
(Rugal in chair.)  Rugal : Hah, hah, hah.  I knew you were faking it!  (Ralf
stands up.)  Ralf : Saw through us, huh!  (Heidern and Clark stand up.)
Heidern : I thought it was you!  Rugal!  Just what are you planning?!
(Rugal's face.)  Rugal : Always in the way, huh?  This time, you won't get
out alive!  (Team.)  Ralf : We'll just see about that, garlic breath!
(Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : You seem quite confident.  But, you
don't have a chance!  (Saisyu.)  (Close up on face.)  Saishu : Heh, heh. Nice
to meet you.  Shall we mix it up?  (Back to team.)  Heidern : Why you...!
Clark : You know him?!  Heidern : He's the leader of the Kusanagis.  Saishu
Kusanagi!  Rugal.  You've brainwashed him!  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)
Rugal : Don't be silly!  There was nothing to wash anyway!
- (Saisyu sitting against wall, beaten.)  Saishu : As I thought, oh, it's
over...!  (Rugal.)  Rugal : Hmm.  You fought well, I'll give you that!
(Raises hand.)  But, you can't even lift a finger to me!  (Rugal powers up,
shredding shirt.)  Rugal : Woooooo.....
- (Rugal holding bloody arm.)  Rugal : Even with my new power, I lost.
(Light appears behind.)  What?  My body....?????  (Far shot of Rugal sur-
rounded by light, then close up.)  Rugal : No...to meet such a fate!  But
I'll be back...you jerks!  (Light consumes Rugal and skull appears.)
(Heidern's face in foreground and Ralf on one knee in background.)  Ralf :
Huh?  Heidern : Finally, consumed by his own evil power.  (Screen moves to
show Clark between.)  Clark : But, just what was that power?  Heidern : I
don't know, but Rugal was a simple puppet.  Ralf : You mean, we have to fight
again?  Heidern : Someday.  (Worm's eye view as three helicopters fly by.)
Now, let's go home.  Ralf, Clark : Roger!  (Close up of Heidern's face.)
Heidern : Sandra.  Clara.  Rest in peace.  The battle is over.

KOREA : - (Blackness.)  Choi : What is going on?  (Team surrounded by gas.)
Chang : It's gas, stupid!  Kim : Oh, no, a trap!  (Fade to black.)  Kim : Uh
Ooooh.  (Rugal in chair.)  Rugal : Rise and shine, sleepyheads!  (Team.)
Choi : Rugal!  Chang, go ahead!  Chang : Rugal, let us join you!  Kim :
Rugal!  I thought it was you!  (Rugal's face.) Rugal : It's me, all right.
But now you'll die a slow, horrible death!  It's the price you pay for
thwarting evil!  (Team.)  Choi : Hey, wait...!  Kim : We can't lose to a
baddie like you, garlic breath!  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : Chill,
dude.  First, meet my flunky!  (Saisyu.)  (Close up on face.)  Saishu :
Saishu Kusanagi's the name.  Shall we flail away?  (Team.)  Chang : If I
could just have a word with you!  Kim : Kusanagi?  Kyo's...!  Brainwashed by
Rugal!  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : What do you think?  (Close up on
face.)  Face the mythic fists of fury.  (Desperate and angry close up of Choi
and Chang.)  Chang, Choi : Hold on here!
- (Saisyu sitting against wall, beaten.)  Saishu : My fate was to lose.  I'm
impressed.  (Rugal.)  Rugal : Heh, heh.  You did well.  (Raises hand.)  But

I'll be back...you jerks!  (Light consumes Rugal and skull appears.)  (Kim's
face.)  Kim : What was that?  (Profiles of Choi and Chang looking at each
other with Kim's back in the distance.)  Choi : Chang.  Chang : What?  Choi :
I'm getting sick of hanging out with Kim.  You too?  Chang : Yeah, I know
what you mean.  He's boring!  Choi : Yeah, you're right!  (Kim turns around
and teardrops appear on Choi and Chang.)  Kim : Hey, you two!  Chang, Choi :
Yeah?  Kim : Tommorrow we train for the next king of fighters tournament,
okay?  Chang, Choi : Yeah...uh...right.  Choi : Geez, again!  I'm speechless!
Chang : I knew it!  (Choi and Chang turn with scared looks and run away as
Kim chases after them.)  Chang, Choi : Run away!!!  Kim : Hey, get back here!
Choi : This is just like the last time!

EDITED TEAM : - (Blackness) What? (Team surrounded by gas.)  What's this
smoke?  Gas!  Ah--gasp!  My body.....  (Fade to black.)  What?  Where is
this?  (Rugal in chair.)  Rugal : Rise and shine, sleepyhead.  (Team.) Rugal!
(Rugal's face.)  Rugal : Yup, but now it's time for you to join me.  (Team.)
What?  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : I'm going to make you into cyborg
warriors.  You'll be terrors : assasinate, destroy, and massacre.  Enough
talk.  I'll show you what I mean.  (Saisyu.)  (Close up on face.)  Saishu :
Saishu Kusanagi's the name.  Let's have a little fun, eh?  (Team.)  I don't
believe it.  (Worm's eye view of Rugal.)  Rugal : You're right!  The Kusanagi
clan's leader and Kyo's father.  I gave life to this corpse!  (Close up of
face.)  Surrender or die like lemmings!
- (Saisyu sitting against wall, beaten.)  Saishu : My fate was to lose.  I'm
impressed.  (Rugal.)  Rugal : Heh, heh.  You did well for a product.  (Raises
hand.)  But now you're going to give me your power.  (Powers up, shredding
shirt.)  Rugal : Woooooo....
- (Rugal holding bloody arm.)  Rugal : Even with my new power, I lost.
(Light appears behind.)  What?  My body....?????  (Far shot of Rugal sur-
rounded by light, then close up.)  Rugal : No...to meet such a fate!  But
I'll be back...you jerks!  (Light consumes Rugal and skull appears.)  (Black
screen.)  Rugal befeated (sic), King of Fighters 95 ends.  Using the prize
money, each member retired happily.  At least until 1996, when.... [To be
continued?]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AIR JUGGLING :

        Air juggling was in King of Fighters '94 on a limited level.  I know
that one combo that works involving air juggling in '94 was Takuma's Light-
ning Legs Knockout Kick and then perform the Tiger Flame Punch before the
opponent hit the ground.  This works once again in '95, but can also be
changed to either use the standing C (if you're close enough) or the Zan
Retsu Ken.  Another example of air juggling is using Kyo's New Wave Smash and
then performing the Dark Thrust before the opponent comes down.  With this
system, combos can go from spectacular to devastating.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COUNTER ATTACKS :

        King of Fighters '95 has also taken a variation of the Alpha Counter
(from Street Fighter Alpha), where you can block then retaliate quickly.  If
your POW meter is full, in the moment you block an attack, perform the motion
for the POW special or any other special move, and it comes out immediately,
taking your opponent by surprise.  The best POW counter that I've seen is
when I was playing my friend.  She was using King and I was using Robert.  We
were at opposite ends of the screen, and she had maximum POW.  I threw a
fireball, which she blocked, and the next thing I knew, she was at my end of
the screen with a Tornado Kick.  It took less than a second for her to block
and hit me with the move, and we were at opposite ends of the screen.  A 2nd
incident is Takuma doing his D Lightning Legs Knockout Kick, and being
interrupted in between the two kicks to be caught in King's Trap Shot.

MOST USED/BEST TEAM COMBINATIONS :

The following is a list compiled by myself and some friends of which team
combinations are most used and best to be used together.  This is in no way
official, but rather the opinion and survey taken from players like yourself.

1. Ryo - Terry - Kyo (The main men!)
2. Saisyu - Kyo - Iori (KoF's characters!)
3. Takuma - Yuri - Ryo (The Sakazaki Family!)
4. Joe - Andy - Mai (Fatal Fury's second dream team!)
5. King - Robert - Rugal (The best dressed fighters!)
6. Kensu - Robert - Mai (Masters of the double air strike!)
7. Clark - Robert - Terry (It's the look...)
8. Benimaru - Joe - King (The kick-boxing trio!)
9. Takuma - Chin - Saisyu (The fathers...masters of their art!)
10. Choi (Rugal) - Eiji - Jeidern (Slice 'n' dice!)
11. Athena - Yuri - Kensu (The token "cute" fighters!)
12. King - Robert - Billy (The bouncers!)
13. Benimaru - Joe - Iori (It's the hair!)
14. Ralf - Kyo - Mai (They're on fire!)
15. King - Iori - Rugal (This is my favorite combination...)

All of these combinations seem to be pretty popular around where I play. I've
only included the ones that are interesting and seem to work well however.
There are a lot of people that pick the characters with fireballs and upper-
cut moves, which is not a good basis for a team, so I haven't included those.
Also, there are a few teams which one person is juggled around (i.e. the 1st
team listed above...Terry is usually replaced with Robert, Yuri, etc.), so I
just took the most popular fill in.  But all of these are good teams and are
used by a lot of people on a frequent basis.

INFO NEEDED/LACKING :

--> Easier way of performing Robert, Kensou, and Mai's air POW specials
--> Anything you think is lacking.
