0.01: Intro_________________________________________________


'DJ Syndrome' is the main tagline of the marketing campaign for 
Beatmania 4th Mix ~The Beat Goes On~. It's also now a guide to Beatmania 
and the rest of the BEMANI series of rhythm games by Konami. While not 
comprehensive, it should begin to answer some of the questions that you 
might have about the games. Also, the focus of this document is 
currently the Beatmania series of Playstation (PSX) games, although much 
more is covered.

This is the main document in my DJ Syndrome series of FAQs, and contains 
not only play information, such as how to unlock hidden songs and song 
lists, but it also lists a lot of other information that may prove very 
useful for the BEMANI series player, such as soundtrack info, and info 
on things such as the BEMANI LCD portables. If you are looking for just 
play information on a specific title, I have condensed the information 
on all games that are covered in the Quick Guide section in to short, 
game-specific FAQs. Please note, however, that this FAQ contains all of 
the information that is in the game-specific FAQs, and then some. Also, 
these game-specific FAQs are lower on my list of things to work on, so 
they will not necessarily be updated at the same time that this FAQ 
is...

A final note: As many readers may have noticed, I have become very busy 
with projects other than FAQs. Thus, I won't be releasing updates to 
this work on as regular of a basis as I previously have. Being the big 
Beatmania fan, I'll try to co-incide this document's updates with new 
Beatmania releases. Thus, expect new ones every few months or so. Also, 
BEMANI games are coming out so quickly that I'm having trouble keeping 
up, so please forgive any errors/ommissions.


         ___________________________________________________
_____Aim:

When this document was first started, it was aimed at being a reference 
piece for the existing Playstation Beatmania games, providing song 
lists, hidden song/mode info, and any other pertinant information. 
Although it has obviously expanded since then, the document was 
considered to have it's first full release (ver.1.00) upon this pre-
requisite's completion. If this work is to ever include the above info 
for all of the BEMANI games (home and arcade), then it will hit v.2.00 
status, although this happening is extremely unlikely. The new focus is 
simply to continue to present BEMANI information in the same style, 
quality, and quantity as has been established, as well as including any 
extra information (such as lyrics, and name sources) that may be of 
interest to the readers.



0.02: Beatmania Quick Guide_________________________________


Overall, here's how things work: Each disc has a core set of songs that 
will be available no matter how badly you score. There are also a set of 
hidden songs for each stage after the first that you much get certain 
scores in certain genres to open up. Once you play a song, it's 
available in Free Mode and Training Mode. A single PSX Beatmania Memory 
Card Save can only hold a single Append Disc's save information (4th Mix 
and beyond are different stories), so I would personally recommend a 
different Memory Card for each Append disc (and don't forget to mark 
them...).


As for hints/techniques, no long techniques section here, just three 
main tips:

- Practice, practice, practice.

- Use the training mode - it's invaluable.

- Buy the controller that was made for the game.


And now for the lowdown and the important information on the 
releases...:

_____Beatmania (Arcade & Append Discs):

Title:   Beatmania
System:  PSX

Intro:   The Playstation game that started it all, the first Beatmania 
release includes songs from the original Arcade release (1st Mix, if you 
will) and the 2nd Mix Arcade release, as well as original Playstation 
tracks. The first disc, entitled 'Arcade' are the tracks from the 
arcade, and the second disc, entitled 'Append' (the first of many as it 
turns out...) has nine non-arcade  and 3rd Mix tracks, including a remix 
of the Metal Gear Solid Main Theme. The Append Disc serves as a sort of 
add-on disc, as you must first insert the original Arcade Disc. This 2-
disc set recently went Platinum (one million copies sold).

__Hidden Songs:

Requirements to get the hidden songs:

Arcade Disc:
In order to get:   score at least: in this (or one of these) genre(s): 

                                   Stage 1:
japanese hip-hop   60,000          any genre
konamix            90,000          any genre

                                   Stage 2:
house              40,000          ballade
house              45,000          break-bts
house              50,000          techno
house              60,000          hip-hop street mix, konamix
house              85,000          japanese hip-hop
minimal techno     70,000          ballade, break-bts
minimal techno     80,000          konamix, techno
minimal techno     90,000          hip-hop street mix, japanese hip-hop

                                   Stage 3:
drum'n bass mix    50,000          dj battle
drum'n bass mix    65,000          house
drum'n bass mix    70,000          minimal techno mix
hard tekno         90,000          dj battle, minimal techno mix 
hard tekno         85,000          house
rave (2nd mix)     90,000          dj battle
rave (2nd mix)     100,000         house, minimal techno mix

Append (Yebisu Mix) Disc:
This disc works a little differently from the others. As far as I can 
tell you merely have to play certain songs to get the full set, not 
score a certain number of points. The following combination will open up 
all the songs:

1st Stage-----2nd Stage-----3rd Stage-----4th Stage
funk          asian trad.   bossa groove  rest...

That should leave you with all of the rest of the songs (Styl Garage, 
Spd Garage, Funky Jazz Groove, Hard House, Bigbeat Mix, and Bossa Groove 
French Version) to choose from in the fourth stage. I'm not positive 
that this will work every time (at this point it still needs checked a 
bit) but it's the one that I got to work...

_____Beatmania Append 4th Mix ~the beat goes on~:

Title:   Beatmania Append 4th Mix ~the beat goes on~
System:  PSX

Intro:   In this release we see quite a bit of new features. The first 
is the addition of the 'just great' (or flashing great) mark. Second, we 
have the addition of the great/good counter - it will keep track of how 
many greats/goods you have gotten in a row. We also have a few more 
options for play, including random and mirror. Add to that a bonus edit 
mode and a bunch of cool new songs, and you've got yourself a great 
disc. Also, it's worth noting that this mix is the first major departure 
of in-game graphics in the Beatmania mixes - you'll find totally 
different song selection and end of stage graphics, to name a few. It 
also runs on a 20,000 max per stage point system as opposed to a 10,000 
max (note that you don't get any extra points for long combos like you 
do in DDR).

Options:  hidden - the notes disappear partway down the screen.
          double - one player plays both the 1P & 2P sides.
          battle - 1P & 2P both play the same notes, and it's a battle 
           to see who ends up with the higher gauge - even if one 
           player ends under the normally required level, they still go 
           on (which is normal for all modes).
          random - the notes occur in the same places in the songs, but 
           the button that you have to push is randomised (the 
           turntable stays the same). note that it's not totally random  
           - the buttons that you need to push basically swap positions 
           for the entire song (for example, all of the notes that were 
           the middle white key are now the left blue key, and so on).
          mirror - the five buttons are mirrored (ie. the left ones are 
           now right, and the right one are now on the left). note that  
           because there are an odd number of buttons, the middle white 
           button stays put. also, the turntable is unaffected.

  (in-game option):
          effects: by pressing the select button during gameplay (ie. 
           during the song) you can turn the effect (selectable in the 
           options menu) on and off.

Getting Bonus Edit Mode:
To open up the bonus edit mode (which features 'traditional' Beatmania 
graphics and so-on), first put in the Arcade disc, then Disc Switch to 
either 3rd Mix or Gottamix, then switch to 4th Mix. You'll be in Bonus 
Edit mode. (note: I switched from Arcade to 3rd to Gotta to 4th to open 
up all of the songs - I'm not sure if all of the songs will open up if 
you only use one of the two discs - more on this as I play more). 

Also, after playing through all of the songs, then booting down the 
system and just playing regular 4th Mix, none of the Bonus Mix songs 
came up in training/free mode, which leads me to think that Bonus Mix 
acts like a whole Append disc, and thus requires a whole separate save 
(the same as any other Append disc - there can only be one Append disc 
per save, thus to have all of the songs available at any time, you now 
need a total of five separate saves - ones for Yebisu, 3rd, Gotta, and 
Bonus Edit, which all branch off of the original Arcade disc save, and 
then the 4th Mix save, which is a separate entity.) I have yet to double 
check this, and after finding that the Bonus Edit songs are available in 
normal mode as well, it may be a while before I do...

__Hidden Songs:
In order to get:   Do one of these things:   
lounge             -   1. Clear Hard mode 5 times.
dance pop (deep...) |- 2. Beat hard mode without losing.
deep house         -   3. Clear Expert mode once.

Secret Modes:
Special Course (Expert Mode):
Beat Hard mode once.

Another Course (Expert Mode):
Beat Hard mode 5 times.

Horrible Course (Expert Mode):
Beat Hard mode 10 times.

Bonus Course (Expert Mode):
Either beat any of the Expert Mode courses once, and you should get the 
Bonus Course, or beat Hard 20 times. Note that opening up this course 
will also open up the Bonus Edit Mode songs for normal gameplay.

Bonus Edit songs available in normal 4th Mix:
There are two ways to do this - open up the Bonus Course either beating 
Expert mode or beating Hard 20 times, or play Hard mode 50 times (not 
necessarily beating it...)

'Another' versions of songs in Hard Mode:
To get the another version of certain songs in Hard Mode, simply hold 
the select button - if another version is available, then a symbol 
saying 'Another' will appear in the area above the 2P symbol. Not all 
songs have another versions. Also, the another versions of the songs are 
very similar, and usually just have a few hard passages added - the 
difficulty (number of stars) stays the same.

Title:   Beatmania 5th Mix ~time to get down~
System:  PSX

Intro:   The first Beatmania to feature popular Western artists, 5th Mix 
takes the 4th Mix interface and adds to it. The end is a well-rounded, 
and very deep, selection of songs. The popular modes introduced 
previously, such as Mirror and Random, appear again as well, as does the 
infamous Bonus Edit Mode. These modes are joined by new ones such as 
High Speed Mode.

__Hidden Songs:

There appear to be two blocks of hidden songs. The first is a set of 
Dancemania (Hard Version) songs, which includes Operator, The Only Way 
is Up, and Up on the Floor. These are accessable in Hard Mode on Stage 
2. I believe that the criteria for this set is to simply beat Hard Mode 
once.

The second set of bonus songs includes Hell Scraper, Thrash Traxx, Linn 
1999, and Denim. These are available at least on Normal Mode, and 
possibly on Hard Mode as well. Frankly, I have no clue how these are 
opened. It may be performance based, as they tend to be there sometimes 
and not others.

Intro:   The sequel to the successful Beatmania GB, Gacchamix takes 
songs from the PSX Gottamix & the LCD AnisonMix, borrows a few from 
popular musicians, and throws some original tunes into the mix. 
Gacchamix also sports one of the oddest setups in the series, with the 
songs grouped by type (Band, J-Girl Pop, etc.) and playable in any order 
(4 songs in each type). As with it's predacessor, Gacchamix shows that 
you don't need CD-quality sound to be fun.

_____Beatmania for WonderSwan:

Title:   Beatmania for WonderSwan
System:  WonderSwan

Intro:   The only release so far to actually include a turntable, the 
Wonderswan version of Beatmania includes songs from the 3rd Arcade mix.
Visually and aurally excellent (the songs even include vocals, 
incredibly impressive for the little system), the WS version's main 
drawback is it's lack of songs - there are only 10 initially, and only 
one real hidden song. Also, it's worth noting that the songs are 
unchanged from the arcade (unlike BM GB, in which the songs are re-
formatted for the GameBoy's layout), which ends up making things a bit 
hard at some points. Also features a continue mode so that allows you to 
turn the system off, and when you turn it back on, you'll be back at the 
stage you were on when the system was switched off - a _very_ nice 
feature...


__Stage Flow:

(*hidden song)


__Hidden songs, mode:

How to get the two hidden songs:
 - These are some of the easiest hidden songs to get - just merely do 
the highest difficulty songs in each stage in Normal (Stage 1=**, Stage 
2=***, Stage 3=****) and you'll get hard techno in stage 4. You don't 
need to win all three in a row - you can continue as much as you want, 
and as far as I know you don't need a certain score. After you play hard 
techno, medley will open up in 'free' mode.

How to get the hidden mode:
In order to open the hidden mode in Expert, Survival, you merely have to 
complete either Expert Course A or Expert Course B without the turntable 
or any key help turned on.

_____Hiphopmania Complete Mix:

  !!also known as Beatmania Complete Mix, Beatstage Complete Mix!!

Titles:   Hiphopmania Complete Mix, Beatmania Complete Mix, Beatstage 
          Complete Mix
System:   Arcades (N.America, Japan, ??)

note: While this is not a quickguide section as the rest of them are, I 
figured that it is worth including since many of the readers of this 
document are from North America, and Hiphopmania Complete Mix is the 
only game in the Beatmania series to be released there.

Intro:    Hiphopmania is the English translation/localization of 
Beatmania Complete Mix, released in the Japanese arcades in 1998. To my 
current knowledge, the game is the same as the Japanese version except 
for the small amount of Japanese text that resides in the game being 
translated to English (all of the text is in the Practice and How To 
Play sections). Although it has been available in the North America for 
quite a while (always under the name Hiphopmania), mass release of the 
title only started recently. It's first major showing, as well as 
Konami's first real announcement of support for the title, was at the E3 
show in L.A. during May of 1999. Wide release started around late-
September to early-October, to my current knowledge.

All of the Complete Mix games contain the same songs that are in found 
Beatmania 2nd Mix and Beatmania 3rd Mix (2nd Mix contains all of the 
songs from the original Beatmania release), and thus, most of the info 
contained in this document should apply as well. A songlist has been 
added, and can be found in the Songlist:: Arcades: section under the 
title Beatmania Complete Mix (I consider the original title to be 
canon).

As I reside in Japan, I cannot verify any info for the actual 
Hiphopmania Complete Mix release (having only played it a few times many 
months ago at the E3 show), and any additional information on this title 
would be helpful.

_____Dance Dance Revolution:

Title:    Dance Dance Revolution
System:   Playstation

Intro:    Konami's first home port of their second, and most popular, 
BEMANI game, DDR one-ups games like Enix's Bust A Move by offering an 
optional foot pad controller that requires you to actually get up and 
move. A single disc release (unlike the Append modes of Beatmania and 
DDR2ndReMix), DDR was the one of the best-selling game of the first half 
of 1999 in Japan, and for good reason - it's really good... As a side 
note, I found this game to be _very_ easy with a normal Playstation 
controller, but much harder with the Original (mat) controller...

*hidden song

(exception: Double - in double, there is only one stage, and all of the 
songs that are normally available in that difficulty are open for play)


__Hidden Songs/Modes:

Hidden Songs:
Unlike Beatmania's hidden songs where as certain score is required, 
DDR's hidden songs are basically time release. You have to beat the game 
on a certain mode a certain number of times, or beat a certain number of 
songs. Once you open up a hidden song, it's becomes 'unhidden' and will 
show up every game. The following are how to open the hidden songs:

Title:                        Artist:       Requirements to open:
make a jam!                   u1            clear normal mode 10 times
boys                          smile.dk      clear 600 songs
i believe in miracles         hi-rise       clear 700 songs
paranoia KECT ~clean mix~     2mb           clear hard mode 100 times
paranoia MAX ~dirty mix~      190           clear hard mode 500 times

A helpful note for getting the paranoia songs:  To get these fairly 
quickly, play Double mode (either by yourself or with a friend using 
controller 2) - Double mode only has 1 stage, as opposed to 3. Now you 
only have to play 100 and 500 songs to open them, as opposed to 300 and 
1500... This also means that you can get all 5 hidden songs by beating 
700 songs (of course, 500 of them have to be hard mode doubles...).

Thanks to Petee Hsu for the methods of unlocking the songs, and the tip 
on double mode...

Hidden Modes:
At the game mode selection screen (easy, normal, hard) press U. This 
should take you into the 'Secret Mode' screen. Now enter the following 
button presses/dance steps:

Another: U, U, D, D, U, U, D, D 
Maniac:  L, L, R, R, L, L, R, R 
Double:  U, U, D, D, L, R, L, R 
Mirror:  L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R

There is also a hidden edit mode that is unlocked by clearing 500 songs 
(similar to how the five hidden songs are unlocked). Thanks to Petee Hsu 
for this as well.

_____Dance Dance Revolution 2nd ReMix:

             **section under development**

Title:   Dance Dance Revolution 2nd ReMix:
System:  PSX

Intro:   While the original Playstation DDR was an excellent game, there 
was some room for improvement. DDR 2ndReMix fixes most of the problems 
that its predecessor had. The once hidden edit mode was made a staple 
feature, available from the start. The number of songs in 2ndReMix 
nearly twice that of the original, and the insanely hard-to-open hidden 
songs from the first disc make appearences here as well. Although the 
disc does feature hidden songs, they have much more realistic open 
requirements. Finally, Konami has also learned from their mistake of not 
including a Disc Switch option with the first game; 2ndReMix adds this 
to its roster as we..

Intro:   Culled from the Beatmania IIDX/DDR link mode, Club Mix Vol.1 & 
2 were the first and second, respectively, Append discs for the popular 
PSX DDR 2ndReMix. The songs featured are almost exclusively from either 
Beatmania or Beatmania IIDX, but with the ability to dance to them 
instead of scratch to them. Throwing away the normal stage flow, the 
Club Mix discs have all the songs available in all three stages. While 
not as openly catchy as the main DDR songs, the Club Mixes provide a 
nice range of songs to dance to.

_____Drummania:

Title:   Drummania
System:  PS2

Intro:   Drummania is a first in many aspects for Konami. Besides the 
obvious 'first BEMANI game for PS2', the title is the first to utilise 
the link-up feature that many of the newer arcade versions feature. By 
selecting 'Session Mode', drummers can grab a friend, as well as a 
Guitar Freaks controller or two, and play together. Drummania also 
features the first high-quality standard controller. While Beatmania had 
the high-quality DJ Station PRO released around the time of Append 3rd 
Mix, Drummania has its own high-quality Drummania Controller available 
right at release, putting other standard controllers (the ASCII 
Beatmania Controller, the DDR mats, etc.) to shame. Finally, Drummania 
is the first BEMANI game to be available in a special controller/game 
package, let alone only available that way. But beside the firsts that 
the game features, it is also one of the most kinetic and fun BEMANI 
titles available. Now if we could just do something about that price...

_____Pop'n Music:

Title:   Pop'n Music
Systems: PSX, Dreamcast

Take Beatmania, remove the turntables, start buttons, effect button, and 
one of the action buttons. Next make the nine action buttons really big 
and colorful. Last, throw in extremely colorful and cartoony characters 
over a pop-based soundtrack, and an all-together way too cheery 
interface, and you have Pop'n Music. The lighthearted branch of the 
BEMANI series, Pop'n Music, is definately that - lighthearted. Boasting 
loud colors and a different cartoon-style character for each stage, 
Pop'n Music is a game that is definately for all ages and all types of 
people. And don't be fooled by the lighthearted take on things - a 20-
rating song with nine buttons is nothing to laugh at...

Maker:   ASCII (licensed by Konami)
Price:   JY4990
Features:None

Intro:   Your standard run-of-the-mill Beatmania controller, this one is 
lightweight and hard to scratch with. Made by ASCII (who usually makes 
excellent controllers...), the Beatmania Controller features the five 
button/one turntable layout from the arcade, as well as start and select 
buttons located at the top. With a light and slightly rounded body, the 
controller is confortable enough to hold, but five very clicky buttons 
(that seem to miss more than you'd like) and one very generally hard-to-
use turntable you're wishing for the decks from the arcade version. The 
big drawback to this controller is the turntable - made out of smoothe 
black plastic, your fingers slide over the turntable more than the 
turntable itself moving. Although this is fixable (by taking apart the 
controller and loosening the turntable screw, and then putting a rubber 
mat of some sort on the top of the turntable), it's more hassle than 
it's worth. 

Verdict: Better than the standard PSX controller or the Dual Shock, but 
only use it if you can't find anything else.


Title:   DJ Station PRO
System:  PSX
Maker:   Konami
SRP:     JY7800
Features:Light-up buttons, headphone jack (through direct audio feed) 
          and separate-channel volume controls

Intro:   After looking for this controller for a month and a half, I 
finally found it at the Sendai Laox, and they had them en force (I'm 
guessing the availability of this controller is going to go up with the 
coming release of 4th Mix Append). Anyway, this is definately the 
Beatmania controller of choice. Aside from actually getting an arcade 
machine, this is the closest you'll come to the feel of the arcade. The 
buttons are fairly comfortable, and light up upon pressing (with the 
help of two AA batteries, included), just like in the arcade. The 
turntable is a big improvement over the ASCII one, but not nearly as 
nice as the arcade one. It is much more similar to the arcade; where the 
ASCII turntable is flat and black without a label, this one has a bit of 
texture to it, helping your fingers so that they don't slip (a big 
problem with the ASCII one), and it has a 'record label' and peg, just 
like in the arcade. It's not nearly the size of the arcade's turntable - 
the DJ Station PRO's table is about the size of a 45, whereas the arcade 
has a full-size turntable, but it's still easy to use and feels very 
comfortable. The design of the controller is very nice as well, giving 
you the feel of the arcade machine. The controller is fairly light, but 
not as light as the ASCII one. As for the headphone jack and volume 
controls, I haven't tried them yet, but I'm guessing that the quality is 
pretty good - it actually has A/V in and out jacks in the back, so 
you're getting the audio feed before the television is. The sliders for 
the volume are fairly nice, and separated into left and right channels. 
The package comes with the extra A/V cable that you'll need to use the 
headphone option as well. As a side note, although the DJ Station PRO is 
much longer than the ASCII controller (the ASCII has it beaten on width 
by a little bit), the box for the DJSpro is much smaller than the 
ASCII's Playstation-system-box sized packaging (which also is the size 
of the DDR controller's package).

Here are some additional comments that I have about the controller now 
that I've really played with it:
When I first used this controller, I really liked it. Now that I've 
truly gotten a chance to use it, I absolutely love it. The turntable is 
very well made, and very sensitive (which is a good thing), so you can 
do a very short, quick scratch and still have it count, a definate plus 
in some of the hard, busier songs. The headphone jack is very, very 
nice, and provides excellent sound quality and volume (I personally 
can't turn it up over about 5 without it being so loud that it's 
uncomfortable). My only quip is that you have to press the buttons 
directly down if you press it at too much of an angle, it gets caught 
and doesn't register. However, this is only really a problem with you're 
laying down and playing... If you're thinking of getting a controller 
and seriously like the game, PLEASE spend the extra money for this one - 
you won't be disappointed.


Verdict: If you see this puppy, pick it up. The interfaces are all 
comfortable, it's very attractive and sleek looking, and it's as close 
to the arcade as you can [currently] get. It's definately worth the 
extra money, and you'll not regret it in the long run. _The_ Beatmania 
controller of choice. Period.


Title:   DJ Man
System:  PSX
Maker:   Joytech (unlicensed)
SRP:     ~JY4980
Features:Dual Shock wrist strap, light up buttons

Intro:   OK. I've never used this controller, so all of the info that I 
have on it is from outside sources. The controller is made of a thick 
black plastic, is fairly rounded in shape, and is slightly larger than 
the PSX console. The action keys are shaped like piano keys, and the 
turntable is lightly textured to prevent finger slippage. It features 
light-up keys and a Dual Shock compatible wrist strap. It comes in a 
cardboard 'carrying case' (ie. a cardboard box with a plastic handle). 

Verdict: I can't really say, as I've never used it. The one person that 
I have recieved an email from who owns the controller is very happy with 
it, and says that it is on par with the DJ Station PRO. Of course, if 
you throw the style factor in, the DJ Station PRO blows it out of the 
water... :)

One thing to note about the above product is that it is -unlicensed-, 
and is not supported by either Konami or Sony. Just a warning.



0.03: Song List_____________________________________________


The songs are grouped by series title (ie. Beatmania, DDR, etc), and 
then by disc, and are in the order that they appear in Free mode when 
they are all opened up, which also puts them in order of difficulty. As 
for the categories, Song Title, Artist, and Genre kind of speak for 
themselves. Diff. is the difficulty, shown in the game as stars, and 
ranges from one (* or 1) to nine (********* or 9), or ??? (which is how 
it is listed in the game). After that comes BPM, or beats per minute. If 
multiple BPMs are shown in the list(example: 100/94/96), then the song 
starts at 100 BPM, then changes to 94 BPM, and finally changes to 96 
BPM. Notes are the number of notes contained in the song (example: 
80/99) - the first number (in this case 80) is the number of notes in 
one player mode, the second number (99) is the number in two player 
mode. If there is a dash (ex:79/-) then the song is only available in 1P 
or 2P mode, and is marked as such after the genre. If there is only one 
number, the number of notes is the same in both 1P and 2P modes... In 
DDR, the different notes and difficulties are for the different versions 
(ie. Normal, Another, Maniac, etc.). Also in DDR (and probably GF as 
well), the number of notes is the a bit deceiving - two steps (or neck 
presses) that occur at the same time count as a single note, as you 
cannot get one of the steps or presses right and the other wrong - if 
you miss one, the entire 'note' is counted as wrong.  In all of the 
titles, if there is a difficulty of ???, then that is how it appears in 
the game - a difficulty that is unknown by me is simply left blank.

_____Beatmania GB2: Gacchamix:

[note: The songs are in the order that they appear in Free Mode (which 
is the same as in the separate stages) - press down so that they flow in 
the right order. Past that, if you're trying to match songs and names 
and know _no_ Japanese, your best bet here is to match up difficulties 
and use the course translations above...]

[note2: I hope you guys appreciate this, as many of the songs/artists 
have kanji in their names, and I have the kanji-reading ability of a 
Norwiegian cat, which meant that I spent a few hours looking all (but 
one) of these kanji up. OK, maybe I'm not _that_ bad (as a Norwiegian 
cat, that is), but still... ;) Anyway, some of the kanji readings may be 
off, due to my lack of knowledge... Finally, any katakana that I can't 
figure out the Romanization for, or names that are in katakana, will be 
in all caps.]

[note: Medley, one of the two hidden songs, is actually clips from all 
eleven of the other songs (hence the name and genre). There are two 
different sections from each song, each a few seconds long, that will 
play randomly. 16 segments will play total, and sometimes the same 
segment will repeat - it's totally random. It's also not judged - after 
the 16th segment, it returns to the Free mode selection (it's only 
available in free mode).]

[please note that the above list was compiled by quickly scribbling data 
onto a paper bag in between stages, so it may not be very accurate (you 
only have about 20 seconds to actually write down the song info...). 
also, I totally ignored the old songs (blue stars) and only wrote down 
the new ones (red stars). hopefully this list should be more complete 
soon...]

0.04: BEMANI Releases_______________________________________


The BEMANI series' history actually started with a little rapping, thin 
as paper puppy named Parappa. When Sony released the Playstation game 
'Parappa the Rapper' in 1997, the world (or at least Japan...) took 
notice of the creation of a new game genre. Enix one-upped Sony with 
their release of Bust A Move Dance and Rhythm Action (aka. Bust A 
Groove). Konami saw this and thought - 'How about _we_ make a dancing 
game...' And they did. It was called 'Dance!Dance!Dance!', and it is 
most truly horrible. So, they moved to the arcades and released a 12-
song DJ Mixing game called Beatmania. And unlike D!D!D!, Beatmania was 
_good_. Good enough that before long, they graced it with a 2nd Mix 
version. And the BEMANI line was born (the name coming from the first in 
the series, BEatMANIa). Following Beatmania in the arcades were 
Pop'n'Music, another 'hit the buttons to make music' game with a 
cartoonish feel, Dance Dance Revolution, a dancing game that actually 
requires you to dance, Guitar Freaks, the game that requires you to push 
buttons and strum a guitar, and lastly Drummania, where you play actual 
Yamaha electric drums to the beat of the music. And of course, the 
BEMANI wave has hit homes as well, with Playstation versions of 
Pop'n'Music, Dance Dance Revolution, and Guitar Freaks, as well as a 
Dreamcast version of Pop'n. Add to this the merchandising, including 
handheld LCD games, t-shirts, and soundtrack & remix CDs, and you've got 
an immensely popular series of games.

The BEMANI arcade and home lines at a glance:

 
            ________________________________________________
_____Arcade:

Note: all of the BEMANI series games are JAMMA standard, and thus will 
work in an JAMMA cabinet. However, keep in mind that the controls of all 
of the games series are unique to that series, and thus you can't 
install a Beatmania board into a Street Fighter II cabinet and expect to 
be able to play it. Generally, none of the BEMANI series can be 
conversions, only dedicated. (You can, from what I've understood, swap 
boards within a series - a Beatmania Complete Mix board will work in a 
Beatmania 3rd Mix cabinet, and so on)

Price notes: All of the BEMANI games have a suggested price of JY200 per 
play.

Rarity: means how common it is to find this release in an arcade. Ranges 
from Common+ (extremely common) to Extremely Rare. Note that the flow is 
C+, C, C-, U-, U, U+, R-, R, R+, ER. This marking will show up 
throughout the rest of the document, and does not cover games outside of 
their region (for example, Beatmania for PSX is Common+ in Japan, but 
would probably rate a Rare- in the US)

BdRarity: this is how common the board, or the guts of the machine, is. 
For example, Beatmania 2nd Mix was very popular in it's day, and thus 
should have a lot of boards out there - however, actually finding the 
game in the arcades is tough, as the board has more than likely been 
replaced by a newer, more popular mix (buying a new board is much 
cheaper than buying a new machine - it would be the equivilant of buying 
a new Playstation every time you wanted to play a new game, but having 
the PSX's cost be over $30,000).

Area (territory) notes: All of the releases are understood to be for 
Japan only. If a release is not intended for the Japanese market, it is 
noted under 'Area:'.

Label: This is a category for the Beatmania series only - it is what 
color the label on the turntable is... If the color is unknown, the 
category won't be there at all...

         to show up in Europe occasionally under this name, as is 
         Beatmania Complete Mix.

         only differences are the title graphic and the translation of 
         any Japanese text - the songs are the same. I know that it 
         exists under this name, but I'm unsure of the territory. Asia, 
         perhaps?

Notes:   Has a modified version of the Double mode, where the image is 
         split in half and shown in the area where the notes usually 
         are, and the notes are shown where the image usually is - this 
         makes it _much_ easier to do, as you don't have to look all 
         the way from one side of the screen to the other... 


Title:   Pop'n Music 3
Format:  One-player arcade, dedicated cabinet
Release: early9/99
Rarity:  Uncommon-
Controls:Nine action buttons
Notes:  


Title:   Beatmania 5th Mix Time to Get Down
Format:  Two-player arcade, dedicated cabinet
Release: mid9/99
Rarity:  Common-
Label:   Yellow
Tagline: 'Love The Beat!'
Controls:Two sets of five action buttons and a turntable, 1P & 2P start
         buttons, effects button
Notes:   The latest installment of Beatmania is the first to feature 
         known (aka. real) artists. Taking a nod from the DDR series, 
         this mix features many songs from the Dancemania series, as 
         well as some 4th Mix classics, as well as (at least) two songs 
         by non-Japanese artists! Much to my delight, 5th Mix features 
         one song each by Mix Master Mike (of Beastie Boy fame, with 
         the song "All-Star" [HipHop]) and Dimitri from Paris (with a 
         Mondo House tune). The 4th Mix stylings are back in full, 
         although the song selection interface has changed so that the 
         song titles are all shown in a box to the right of the screen, 
         along with difficulty (difficulties are shown as numbers in 
         colored stars - red stars are new songs and blue stars are old 
         songs, if memory serves). Even the clubs that you play at 
         (shown on the difficuly select screen) are the same. Now let's 
         just hope that the Western-artist trend continues in later 
         Mixes (Konami - hint: license the song "Cello" by Here. - it's 
         perfectly suited for Beatmania)


Title:   Pop'n Stage
Format:  Two-player arcade, dedicated cabinet
Release: 10/99
Rarity:  Uncommon-
Controls:Two sets of five pressure sensitive foot-pads, song selection 
         buttons, start buttons.
Notes:   Yes, Pop'n Music and DDR have had a bastard child, and it's 
         name is Pop'n Stage. This new title is basically a cross 
         between DDR and PnM, hands down. Instead of the plus shaped 
         pads of DDR, you get two sets of five pads in the shape of an 
         X for PnS (this layout is somewhat decieving, as a one-player 
         game, or six-button mode, uses half of each X - the player 
         stands in the middle of the Xs... Of course, the other version 
         is 10-button mode, and can be seen as either a sort of DDR 
         double mode or a two player mode). And of course, the same PnM 
         design is used throughout the 
         game. Sure to be a big hit for fans of PnM...

Format:  One-player 'arcade', dedicated 'cabinet'
Release: 10/99
Rarity:  --
Controls:Four pressure sensitive foot-pads, more...
Notes:   A cross between DDR and DAM (a form of karaoke), this 
         'arcade' release is actually more akin to the PSX version of 
         DDR in look. Definately geared more towards karaoke bars than 
         arcades, it's a fairly lightweight-looking unit that has a 
         screen that displays both the dance steps as well as the 
         lyrics to the song. That's right, dance and sing at the same 
         time... Oh my...

         supports up to 2 Guitar Freaks controllers for Session play, 
         so that one person can play the drum part and the other(s) the    
         guitar part (this is do-able in the arcades, too, as long as 
         the GF and DM machines are linked...). Includes the Drummania 
         controller in a special package.


Title:   Drummania Controller
System:  Playstation2
SRP:     open price: included with Drummania
Release: 4mar2000
Rarity:  --
Notes:   This controller comes in two main pieces, and from the 
         pictures looks absolutely massive. First, you have the main 
         five pad (3-drum, 2-cymbol) body, which also sports the Start 
         and Select buttons, and the foot (bass) pedal is connected by 
         a basic AV cord (which is removable). The color scheme is red 
         and black, and the controller is pretty nice looking. The pads  
         are rubber (a good thing), and the foot pedal is a foam pad 
         with a DDR-type sensor on it. Drumsticks are included as well.
         No word on original PSX compatability, although the PSX and 
         PS2 do use the same kind of ports (for example, the PS2's 
         DualShock2 is perfectly compatible with the PSX), so it is 
         possible. Not that you'd have anything to play on it if it was 
         compatible...

         fact that the in-game graphics are different from 1st, 2nd, 
         and 3rd Mixes (possibly 4th Mix graphics?), and that the disc 
         is rumoured to contain some popular European songs, including 
         music by The Orbital, Fatboy Slim, and Moloko. It also 
         contains some aspects of gameplay that were unfamiliar to h0l, 
         who provided me with this information - again, possibly a 
         modified 4th, which contains additional gameplay versions?

_____Beatmania/Hiphopmania Hidden Modes:

While this isn't really a hidden mode, it goes overlooked a lot of 
times: By pressing the Select button in any of the PSX Beatmania titles, 
you'll activate the Effects Button, which will turn on the effect that 
you've selected from the options menu. This really enhances the sound of 
some of the songs...

Although I haven't done a lot of looking around for codes yet, I found 
these on gamewinners.com and thought that they were worth including. I 
haven't had a chance to try them out, so I can't confirm that they work, 
or give you any help with them... Anyway, here they are, copied and 
pasted directly from gamewinners.com - knock yourself out...

Hidden Mode 1:
 Hold L + R (the two back keys on the Beat Mania controller) and press 
Start when the menu with the "Press Start Button" selection appears. 
Release those buttons and press Left + X (the two white keys on the left 
and right side). A sound will confirm correct code entry. The "Hidden 
Mode 1" option will now be available. 

Double play mode:
 Hold Left + Square + X (the three white keys) and press Start when the 
menu with the "Press Start Button" selection appears. Release those 
buttons and press L + R (the two black keys). A sound will confirm 
correct code entry. An option for double play mode will now be 
available.

Hiphopmania (I'm assuming this is for Complete Mix, but it was not 
specified):

Put in the required coins/tokens/moneycard. Do not press start yet.

Hold down 1 and 4 and spin the turntable around once clockwise. Let go
of the buttons. Then hold down 2 and 5 and spin the turntable clockwise
again. Let go of the buttons. Next, hold down 1 and 4 again and press 
the 1p or 2p Start button. Right after you press Start, let go of the 
buttons quickly and hold down the 2 key until it gets to the difficulty 
section (easy/hard/practice/etc), then go to hard mode, and you should 
have all the levels, including the hidden ones. Doing this on 2p mode 
will also turn on battle mode.



__4th Mix Arcade:

This is directly from the Konami Homepage. It may work with the PSX 
version, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet...

_____DDR Hidden Modes/Characters:


__Modes:

To access the harder modes in DDR, at the game mode selection screen 
(easy, normal, hard) press U. This should take you into the 'Secret 
Mode' screen. Now enter the following button presses/dance steps:

Another: U, U, D, D, U, U, D, D 
Maniac:  L, L, R, R, L, L, R, R 
Double:  U, U, D, D, L, R, L, R 
Mirror:  L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R

U=up, D=down, L=left, R=right, all on the control pad (directional pad, 
D-pad, etc.)

This will open up the above modes, as well as combinations thereof. The 
modes will also be saved to your memory card.

(taken from Dance Dance Revolution Konami Official Guide; clarified, 
confirmed, etc. at GameSages.com)

There is also a hidden edit mode that is unlocked by clearing 500 songs 
(similar to how the five hidden songs are unlocked). Thanks to Petee Hsu 
for this as well.


__Characters:

At the mode select screen, right after you press start on the title 
screen, hold either left or right on the control pad - each direction 
will get you a different set of characters. Thanks to Mike Corbett for 
the tip.

_____Beatmania Append 4th Mix Internet Ranking:

If you get a decently high score (I'm not sure exactly what you have to 
get) in any of the seven expert courses, you'll recieve a password so 
that you can enter your score on the Konami website. Here's how it 
works:

 - After playing Expert Mode (and scoring well enough) and entering your 
DJ name, you'll recieve a password in the following format:

DJ Name (1P):
DJ Name (2P): [if applicable]
Password:
 
(The DJ names are the four letter names that you enter at the high score 
board.)

You'll also get a web URL: http://www.konami.co.jp/kcej/

Log online using your choice of computer and web browser, and either 
enter the above URL, or the below one to get you directly to the 
Internet Ranking section.

http://www.konami.co.jp/kcej/4th_ir/password.html

After that, you'll find an entry screen with about a dozen different 
choices - here is a rough translation of the page:

-----
DJ Name (1P)
DJ Name (2P)
Password

Name

Email

Comments

Gender      ()Male    ()Female
Age?    ()under 10  ()10-19  ()20-29  ()30-39  ()over 40
Last Name?

??
Append 4th Mix Favorite Song (select from pulldown menu)


  [RESET]   [SUBMIT]

-----

After you're done, submit, and look at the scores! A note - they are all 
fairly high. As of the early morning of 14sept99, the top score was well 
over 1400. 

As another note, it is possible to get a high score password without 
actually finishing the expert mode course.

Final note: The internet ranking is going to go on for one month - 
9sept99 - 8oct99.

_____Beatmania Controller Button Guide:

Within the Beatmania games, the controllers are automatically configured 
by selecting the 'Original' controller option. But have you ever wanted 
to use the controller in another game (like Pop'n Music's 5-button mode) 
but didn't know how to configure the controller? Here's a diagram of how 
the Beatmania controllers are laid out:

    -----   -----     
    |   |   |   |           -----
    |L1 |   | R1|         /   U   \
    |   |   |   |        /         \
    -----   -----       |           |
-----   -----   -----   |           |
|   |   |   |   |   |    \         /
| S |   | X |   | O |     \   D   /
|   |   |   |   |   |       ----- 
-----   -----   -----

S=square
U=up on the directional pad
D=down on the directional pad
the others should be self explainatory, and of course Select and Start
   are just what they say they are...

 
                                        ____________________
_____Beatmania 4th/5th Mix Difficulties:

One of the additions in the new 4th/5th Mix interfaces is a better 
difficulty rating system. Much more like DDR, 4th and 5th have 7 
difficulties, and each one has it's own title. Originally, there was a 
5-star ratings system (although some songs did have 6 stars) and there 
were only three titles for the six levels... While not as creative as 
DDR's titles, it is a nice change...

* very easy
** easy
*** normal
**** hard
***** very hard
****** strong hard
******* ultimate hard


                      ______________________________________
_____DDR Difficulties:

DDR has names for all eight of it's difficulties (unlike Beatmania 1st, 
2nd, and 3rd, which only has three names for it's six). Here's a chart 
listing all eight (note: obviously, the *s are the number of feet in the 
difficulty, and the more feet, the harder):

* simple
** moderate
*** ordinary
**** superior
***** marvelous
****** genuine
******* paramount 
******** exorbitant

                                         ___________________
_____Beatmania GB2; English Translations:

As you may have noted, many of the songs in Beatmanis GB2: Gacchamix are 
in Japanese. This is merely a translation of the song's titles into 
English, with the best of my ability (which isn't that great, I'll warn 
you right now, so some of these may be pretty off...) English is the 
song's English translation, while In Game is how it appears in game (a 
few of the songs are already in English) - again, katakana is in all 
caps. The Gottamix Course is not listed as all of the songs are already 
in English. If you're looking for translations of the menu screens, 
please see the Gacchamix section of the Quick Guide section of this FAQ.

This list is merely a list all of the Beatmania songs in grouped by the

Gottamix, 4=Append 4th Mix, GB=Beatmania GB, G2=Beatmania GB2, and

_____BEMANI outside of Japan:

While the BEMANI series started, and is the most popular, in Japan, it 
has recently started to spread to other regions:

Europe: Recieving the second most BEMANI games of a single region (Japan 
being first, obviously), Europe has recieved both Beatmania (as either 
Beatmania or Hiphopmania, the former probably being a Japanese import) 
and DDR (as either DDR or Dancing Stage) in the arcades. A Playstation 
version of Beatmania, entitled 'Beatmania European Edit', is due by the 
end of the year. No DDR PSX game has been announced as of yet.

Americas: North and South America have recieved Beatmania in the arcades 
under the somewhat decieving (and in my opinion, just plain bad) name 
'Hiphopmania'. Dance Dance Revolution is also available in the arcades. 
No home releases have been announced yet.

Asia: Asia has also recieved a few BEMANI games, although details here 
are sketchy - in some areas, Japanese imports abound, but as for 
official territory releases, I believe that both Beatmania and DDR have 
hit, the former possibly as BeatStage.


                     ______________________________________
_____Facts & Figures:


This section is simply a collection of misc. facts and figures on the 
BEMANI series...

 - Beatmania currently leads the BEMANI series for number of variations 
(arcade, home, portable, and LCD) at 19, while DDR is at 9 (going on 
15), Pop'nX has 8, Guitar Freaks has 3, and finally Drummaina exists 
only in a single format.
 - Both the original Beatmania and Dance Dance Revolution Playstation 
games have sold over a million copies.
 - The single most prolific song in the entire BEMANI series is 
20.november, which is in at least 10 different games, and has at least 5 
different mixes/versions.
 - The fastest song in the home versions of Beatmania was previously 
Hell Scraper (gabbah) by l.e.d. light-g, from GottaMix/5th Mix, which 
maxes at 200 BPM, although it has been overtaken by Krymson (digital 
hardcore) by RAM, from 5th Mix, which blows by at an amazing 240 BPM. 
Neither of these matches the Drummania song Across the Nightmare, which 
is apparently 300 BMP (although I don't think it is truly 300 BMP). As a 
total side note, the fastest song ever recorded was Thousand by Moby: it 
maxes at 1000 BMP.
 - The slowest song in Beatmania is It's Your Funky Life (reggae) from 
Beatmania GB, which blows away the competition with a lethargic 60 BMP.
 - The song with the most notes in Beatmania (1P) is Hell Scraper, with 
a whopping 577 notes, over 100 more than the number two song, which is 
BEMANI Hit Tracks (nonstop megamix) by the K.M.D.J.team from Gottmix, 
which contains 468 notes. A close third place is Logical Dash [another] 
(happy), by DJ Taka, from 4th Mix, and contains 467 notes.
 - The song with the least number of notes in Beatmania is DJ Battle, 
from Beatmania Pocket 2, with a wimpy 27 notes.
 - The largest BMP change occurs in Lovegirl in Summer ~Guhroovy 
Hardcore Mix~ (breakbeats) by Luv2Shy, which begins at 95 BMP and 
doubles to 190 BMP about halfway through.
 - The song with the longest complete title is "Lovegirl in Summer 
~Guhroovy Hardcore Mix~ (breakbeats) by Luv2Shy featuring Sonomi" with 
69 characters (not counting spaces, the 'by', or the (), but counting 
the ~s, which are part of the song's title)
 - Hell Scraper (gabbah) contains a total of 666 notes in 2P mode (I 
really shouldn't have to explain this one...).
 - Inventive Japanese Beataddicts have invented numerous new ways to 
play, including '2P Cross' (where one player mans the 1P keys and the 2P 
'table, and the other player is on the inside of him manning the 2P keys 
and the 1P 'table), 'One Finger' (playing using only one finger), 'Back 
Play' (playing with your back to the screen), and the famous 'Double 
Play' (one person plays a 2P game, manning both sets of keys and both 
turntables).
 - The initial release of Beatmania only had 9 unique songs (ie. songs 
with different titles, not counting additional mixes), while the later 
releases have gotten up to 39 for home releases (Append 4th Mix) and 
over 60 in the arcades (IIDX Substream Club Version 2)
 - The BEMANI series is less than two years old, yet already has 50 
separate games in it (21 different arcade games, 12 home releases, 6 LCD 
games, and at least 11 more on the way). This easily makes it the most 
prolific set series in video game history (with the MegaMan/Rockman 
series coming in second with over 20 titles, but spread over a 10 year 
period). Even Beatmania's 19 current titles over 2 years rivals 
(although does not surpass) MegaMan's 10 year stint... (please note that 
I'm referring to BEMANI as a 'set series', as opposed to an assumed one 
- an example of the latter would be grouping all of Mario's appearances 
into a single series, which still probably wouldn't beat the BEMANI 
series... also, I'm counting arcade and home releases separately, as 
they should - this may put MegaMan over 30, and possibly 40... but then, 
I'm not the MegaMan expert, now am I?)
 - Traditionally, the BEMANI series has been presented entirely in 
English (with the exception of the 'how-to-play' sections), with the 
first Japanese song title occurring in Pop'n Music, and the second one 
not occurring until Beatmania Pocket Summer Mix. 



                   ________________________________________
_____Boot Problems:


Something that has come to my attention recently is the matter of people 
having trouble getting certain games to boot, for various reasons. 
Here's a quick rundown on how to go about solving these problems (note 
that all of the BEMANI releases so far are Japanese territory, so if 
you're using a console meant for either Europe or North America, you 
need a mod chip or other similar device - this FAQ assumes that you know 
that, and will not go into any detail whatsoever on the topic - there 
are plenty of other resources on the web for such difficulties):

--Obviously, only use this section if you can't get your game to boot - 
some people have said that they have a chipped PSX, and that certain 
games will boot fine that are supposedly anti-mod...--


__Beatmania Append 4th Mix:

Many people have reported problems getting 4th Mix to boot up in 
anything but the Bonus Edit Mode. In all of the cases that I've recieved 
email about, this is due to the fact that the readers are booting from 
Arcade -> 3rd Mix -> 4th Mix. Upon looking in the instruction book, 
you'll see that one of the first pages has a diagram saying that if you 
boot from Arcade -> 3rd/Gotta -> 4th, you will in fact recieve the Bonus 
Edit Mode, and that in order to recieve the regular 4th Mix, you must 
boot Arcade -> 4th or Arcade -> 3rdMini/Yebisu -> 4th.  

I suspect that most of the people having these problems, and thus 
booting in this manner, is that 3rd Mix is not mod-protected (ie. 
unbootable on systems modified for all-region play), and thus the only 
way to boot the 4th Mix disc on a modded system is to do it in the 
manner that they are doing (for some reason 3rd -> 4th bypasses the mod-
check, while Arcade -> 4th obviously does not).

In the end, you have a few options if you are encountering this problem. 
The first is to buy a Japanese Playstation, which is really recommended 
- I own a Japanese and an American one, and for import-heavy gamers, 
this is by far the best choice due to the massive amount of mod-
protecting games. On the other hand, I realise that an imported ~US$200 
PSX system isn't within everyone's means, so the second, and less 
recommended, method is detailed below (under Mod-Protected 
Games/GameShark methods:). It involves the use of a GameShark or similar 
'cheat' device to bypass the mod-check. Other methods exist, such as 
Game Enhancers, Gold Fingers, and stealth mods, but I know nothing about 
them other than the names.


__Beatmania/Append discs:
One reader has reported problems getting the Append Yebisu disc to boot 
on a PSX with an external mod chip. This problem has not yet been 
solved, and any input would be appreciated. Please note that this may be 
the fault of the chip, and not the game. 

This problem, however, has brought to my attention that if you are using 
a method that requires the lid of the PSX to be propped open, you must 
release whatever you're using to press down the lid sensor when you Disc 
Switch, or the PSX will not boot the Append Disc.

There is one way around the Gottamix and 4th Mix mod-checks - 
  1. Boot the Arcade disc.
  2. Disc Switch to Append 3rd Mix.
  3. Disc Switch to Append GottaMix or 4th Mix (note that in 4th Mix, 
you will only be able to access the Bonus Edit mode using this method)

               ____________________________________________
_____Grey Area:

Something that has come to my attention as of late is a number of 'grey 
area' matters. Past the obviously illegal things such as the TopMax GF 
controller and pirated games, the BEMANI world has recently met another 
world: that of emulation. There are also rumours of fan made Append 
Discs...


__Emulation:

While many people mistake emulation for something that is totally 
illegal, in truth it is a fairly grey area of the law. This document 
does not cover the illegal aspects of emulation, but rather brings to 
light the greyer areas (although none of this is endorsed by the author 
of this document nor the web sites that this document is found on). 

There exists a Beatmania emulator called 'BM98', which runs on fan-made 
files called .bms files. The emulator is backwards-engineered and 
freeware, making it (fairly) legal (to my knowledge). Although it does 
not contain any Beatmania or BEMANI references, it doesn't take a genius 
to see that it is clearly Beatmania under a different name. The emulator 
does not run off of copied ROM images, as most do, but rather fan-made 
files (.bms format), which reference .wav files for the audio and .bmp 
files for the video. The BMS files are made with another program called 
BMS Creator (also freeware), and can be simply made from any .wav files 
or .bmp files. The emulator itself is customisable, with the GUI being 
made up of easily alterable .bmp files. While the emulator called 'BM98' 
is the most popular, there are others as well, including 'TypeMania'...  
Please note that these programs and files are not illegal in nature 
(again, to my knowledge), but can be if the program is altered to 
include copyrighted images/words, and if the samples or video for the 
BMS files include copyrighted works.

I am also aware of a DDR emulator, although info on this is currently 
scarce.

Finally, although I hate to add all of this, it seems to be a necessity. 
As I have stated before, _I do not endorse any of the programs covered 
in this section_ - period. This means that I will not provide any links 
to websites covering such topics or containing related files, and I will 
not provide any of the above files. I am very staunch on this. Also, 
keep in mind that any Beatmania/DDR/etc. songs that have been modified 
for play on BM98 are _illegal_, as they contain copyrighted 
images/sounds that are under the creative control of Konami. I do not 
know where if such files even exist, and if they do I do not know where 
to obtain them. Under no circumstances will I endorse the distribution 
of such files containing the copyrighted intellectual property of 
Konami. Put in simple English, DO NOT ASK ME FOR BM98 FILES, ESPECIALLY 
BEMANI SONGS - I WILL _NOT_ SEND THEM TO YOU.


__Fan-Made Append Discs:

I have heard a single rumour about this topic. Basically, if it is true, 
it would fall under the same file as the BMS files in the above section 
- as long as the discs didn't contain copyrighted 
files/sounds/images/etc, it would make sense that these would be legal. 
Again, neither the author nor the websites endorse this.


__Closing Words on Grey Areas:

A closing word on the above grey area matters: I, nor the webmasters of 
the sites that you have found this on, suppport the above matters, and 
they are presented merely because they are part of the mass that is 
BEMANI. Please do not email me asking for more information on the above 
topics; any emails will replied to with this very paragraph in the body 
of the email, and none of the requested information will be sent with 
it. If you really want to learn more about these topics, I suggest that 
you visit one of the web's many search engines, such as Yahoo! 
[http://www.yahoo.com] or Metacrawler [http://www.metacrawler.com] and 
search for the above topics. Also, the author and the webmasters will 
not be responsible for any damage that you may do to your 
PSX/computer/etc. through using any of the programs/etc. covered in 
'Grey Area'.

             ______________________________________________
_____Rumours:

This is a section for news that can't possibly confirmed, but is worth 
putting up anyway. Our first one is from "h0l":

   "I was at ECTS in London a couple of days ago... they had 
    'professional' DDR dancers on the stand and one of the tunes they 
     were dancing to seemed to be Run DMC vs. Jason Nevins - "It's Like 
     That" (big European No.1 quite recently)."

The RunDMC/Nevins tune is definately not in any of the released versions 
of DDR - a possibility for 3rd Mix? He also mentioned in a later email 
that it may have just been a DJ spinning over the music of the game, and 
that the tune isn't actually in the game...

   **update: the song has been confirmed to be in the European DDR, 
called Dancing Stage.**

                                     _______________________
_____Beatmania/BeatMania/Beat Mania?:

A quick note on the actual title of Konami's DJ Simulation game. The 
logo is written 'beat mania', all in lower case, with a very small, but 
noticable, space inbetween the 't' and the 'm'. Konami sometimes writes 
is as one word, all lower case ('beatmania'), and sometimes as two 
words, with normal caps ('Beat Mania'). I've never seen Konami write it 
as one word with two caps ('BeatMania'), but I've seen it that way other 
places. The katakana on the PSX games and the books is written as one 
word (no spaces inbetween the 'to' and the 'ma'), and for that matter 
the actual katakana spelling is 'beetomania'. I personally prefer one 
word, with either a capital or lower-case 'B.' In this FAQ, for 
clarity's sake, I capitalise the 'B', since it's easier to read. In 
reality, I'm not sure that there is a definate way to write the name of 
the game, although the all-lower-case, one-word version gets used an 
awful lot...

In an update to this section, Beatmania Append 4th Mix has brought new 
light to this 'arguement' - Beatmania now appears as one word on the 
cover (as opposed to the small space seen in previous releases). Now I 
guess it's just a matter of Beatmania vs. BeatMania (although I will 
still use Beatmania...)

Another point to mention is a variation on this whole subject - 
Drummania vs. DrumMania. Again, I'll use Drummania in this doc., but 
just want to bring it to light... (Drummania, though, has never had a 
space between the two m's...)


                  __________________________________________
_____Artist Names:

Some notes about the artist names in the Beatmania series. I'm not sure 
how many are real artists, and how many are 'invented' artists, made up 
my the Konami staff. Many of the names do seem to be taken from popular 
artists. Here are some thoughts on where the artists' names came from 
(and thanks to Bill for much of the info):


Artist:            Source:

__Beatmania:
dust fathers       The Dust Brothers, a popular producer/remix/artist 
                    team. Of course, there were two artists with this 
                    name at one time - the Chemical Brothers were 
                    originally the Dust Brothers as well, but when 
                    the other Dust Brothers found out in 1996, they 
                    threatened a lawsuit, hence the change in name.

DJ Mazinger         |-all actually techno artist Hiroshi Watanabe
Crunky Boy          |  
DJ FX              -
the bald heads     More of a nod to the ska culture than a specific 
                    artist
dj konami          One of the most blatant, as the series is done by 
                    the Konami
Co-Key             Actual artist
DJ Soma            Actual artist
Prophet-31         The popular techno act The Prodigy is named after 
                    a piece of studio equipment, and a prophet is 
                    piece of studio equipment as well. 
Cheap Forest       Deep Forest, an "artist" (term used VERY loosely) 
                    who is recognized by the music press as one who 
                    would plunder world music and recycle it into 
                    elevator music drivel mixed with beats.  Notice 
                    that "Cheap Forest" does the "Asian Traditional," 
                    which is traditional Asian music recycled with 
                    beats. 
ESPACIO BROTHERS   Part Chemical Brothers homage, part homage to 
                    Space (which is espacio in Spanish) the after-
                    hours club of Ibiza. 
Emotion of Sound   The initials, e.o.s., are probably a reference to 
                     a J-Pop band from the 80s.  Another possibility 
                     is a reference to The Ministry of Sound - a club 
                     that is a landmark of corporate clubbing based 
                     in London. Another possibility is the 80's band 
                     Art of Noise.
staccato two-J     Probably a nod to Pizzicato Five, a J-Pop group. 
                    Staccato and Pizzicato are both very sharp ways 
                    to play notes in music. The 'J' is for Japanese, 
                    the language the song is in.
staccato two-F     See staccato two-J, but replace the 'J' for 
                    Japanese with 'F' for French.
Herbie Hammock     The first half is a nod to the classic jazz 
 & His Band         musician Herbie Hancock (thanks to ". Charon" 
                    for the tip), and the second half could be taken 
                    from any number of groups that ended in "& His 
                    Band"
DUB-GB             Could be any number of dub (another techno genre, 
                    and the cornerstone of the popular big beat 
                    subgenre) groups, including The Dub Pistols, Dub 
                    Narcotic Sound System, Asian Dub Foundation, etc. 
                    The 'GB' could possibly be a reference to 
                    Nintendo's GameBoy, which also has a version of 
                    Beatmania...
SLAKE              This could possibly be Fluke, a UK techno act who 
                    has actually already had music in a video game - 
                    the song "Atom Bomb" (instrumental version, I 
                    believe) was in the killer Pysgnosis futuristic 
                    racer Wipeout XL (Wipeout 2097 for our European 
                    friends).
K.M.D.J.team       Probably 'Konami Music Disc Jockey Team', but that's 
                    just a guess...
tiger YAMATO       Sounds familiar, but can't place
Dimitri from Paris Real artist
Mix Master Mike    Real artist (the DJ for the Beastie Boys)
"R3" (song title)  A take-off of the Namco game R4 (Ridge Rac Type 4)


__Dance Dance Revolution:
The Olivia Project   "Have You Ever Been Mellow" is a tune that 
                      Olivia Newton-John did in the 70s, hence the 
                      tie-in.
"Have You Never      See above, The Olivia Project.
 Been Mellow" (song title)
kc & the             A real, and fairly popular, disco band.

bus stop             This comes from the disco dance move called the 
 feat. carl douglas   "bus stop". The song "Kung Fu Fighting" was 
                      originally done by Carl Douglas, hence the 
                      'feat. carl douglas' addition.

190                  This is taken from the artist listed for the 
                      original mix of Paranoia, 180.
chumbawumba          A real (and incredibly over-popular) band.

__Pop'n Music:
LITTLE FINGERS      Sounds familiar, but can't place
Uncle Jam(character)This is one of the characters that is seen in the 
                     Jam Jam Reggae [reggae] song on the first PSX 
                     Beatmania game. He's also a character from 
                     George Clinton's Parliament/Funkadelic 
                     mythology.   
act deft            Probably from Daft Punk, a popular French techno 
                     group.
THE RICHIE SISTERS  Possibly a nod to The Richie Family, a disco group. 
                     Another thought is The Pointer Sisters + Lionel 
                     Richie=The Richie Sisters.
ORIGINAL            There was a British artist that had a name that 
 SOUND TRACKS        was very similar to this, but I'm not sure of 
                     his name off hand... And of course, there's the 
                     possibility that 'Original Sound Tracks' is just 
                     meant to convey that it's a film 'original 
                     soundtrack', like the 60s Bond movie type thing 
                     that John Barry did.
JV&THE SEXY         JV is a homage to JB, the man, the legend, 
 MACHINE GUN         James Brown. 'Sexy Machine' is related to Sex 
                     Machine by said legend, James Brown. To boot, 
                     James Brown's backing band was called "The JBs", 
                     further strengthening the ties. Also  "Machine 
                     Gun" is a funk instrumental tune by the Commodores                       
                     (the Beastie Boys sampled it, with the Dust   
                     Brothers' help for "Hey Ladies" from _Paul's 
                     Boutique_.
                     Another possibility, although remote, is a nod 
                     to Sister Machine Gun (both have the same 
                     initials, SMG). However, the genre is pretty far 
                     off, as Sister Machine Gun is an industrial rock 
                     band.    
Windslope           Windslope is meant to be Kraftwerk, and that whole 
                     robotic pop thing. Some of the names just sorta 
                     work when you know who it is, but otherwise it's 
                     impossible to guess.
Kraft (Character)   Again, a (much more direct) reference to Kraftwerk.

You gave me a smile when you said hello.

Now everything's so good inside.
Never realized that I didn't hide
the feeling that came when you felt the same.

to think of my life and to start it over with you.

Cause you know we've been in a maze of love
and we are losing control to get away.
Here I am walking on a hill in this town.
I gave my childhood that seems like yesterday.

If you were here with me

If you were here with me
you could see what I am looking for now.

__Little Bitch:

One, two!

If you ever hear a noise in the night
your body starts to sweat.
It shakes and shivers in fright;
You always need to call
Mother, she hates your guts.
She knows that you love her
so she holds you tight
all through the night
until the broad day light.</pre><pre id="faqspan-6">
But when she doesn't come home
you have to sleep alone.
Then you wet your bed
and I think that's sad
for a girl of nineteen.
It's more than sad;
it's obscene!

One, two!

And you think it's 'bout time that you died
and died in peace
so you decide on suicide.
You tried but you never quite carried it out.
You only wanted to die in order to show how
And if you think it's gonna bleed all over me,
you're even wronger than you know. Let it be.
And the only things you wanna see are kitsch*.
The only thing you wanna be is rich.
Your little pain; a body knows things that twitch.
I know you know you're just a little bitch!

The beauty of a child, innocent, no lies.

__Good Times

When you're walking down the street and it's sunny,

When you're feeling all alone and lonely,
come to where the action is.
Lot of people walking down the avenue.
Everybody's looking for something new.
You know it don't hurt to have a little fun.

Some say that life is like a rainy day.
They say there's no hope for the youth today.
Life's how you make it, give yourself some freedom.

_____Other rhythm games:

The rhythm genre, although led by the BEMANI series, is not by any means 
confined to it. While not a comprehensive list, here's a brief look at 
some of the other rhythm games/series, in approxomite order of release: 
[please note that all of the games are Japanese unless marked]


__Quick list of recommended games:
Parappa the Rapper (PSX)
Bust A Move Dance and Rhythm Action (aka. Bust A Groove) (PSX/arcade)
Umjammer Lammy (PSX)
Bust A Move 2 Dance Tengoku Mix (PSX/arcade)
Samba de Amigo (arcade)


__Longer list of all games:
Title:   Parappa the Rapper (aka. Parapparappa)
Company: Sony Computer Entertainment International (SCEI)
System:  PSX  -US, Japan-
Type:    Rapping 
Rarity:  Common (JP), Uncommon+ (US)
Notes:   The game that started the rhythm genre. The design is very 
good, albeit stylised, being a cartoony feel with paper-thin characters. 
The music is catchy, although the lyrics and subject matter can be... 
odd. While it is the first, it is still one of the best. Recommended.


Title:   Bust A Move Dance And Rhythm Action (aka. Bust A Groove)
Company: Enix (989 Studios in the US)
System:  PSX -US, Japan-
Type:    Dancing
Rarity:  Common (JP), Uncommon (US), Rare (JP Ltd. Edition)
Notes:   The first dancing game, BAM is styled after a fighting game, 
where two dancers square off one against another. Very good music, and 
very good character design. One of the best in the genre. There was also 
a two-cd limited edition set that shipped to Japan - the second CD is 
possibly a Windows CD... Anyway, in whatever form, it comes highly 
recommended.


Title:   Stolen Song
Company: SCEI
System:  PSX
Type:    Guitar
Rarity:  Common
Notes:   Only uses one action button. Fairly bland.


Title:   Dance!Dance!Dance!
Company: Konami
System:  PSX
Type:    Dancing
Rarity:  Common
Notes:   Obviously inspired by BAM, D!D!D! is a poor attempt at a rhythm 
game. The dance system is incredibly bad, and the characters and songs 
are very uninspired. The only saving grace is the ability to put in your 
own music CDs and dance to them (or at least try to dance to them...).


Title:   Great Hits
Company: Enix
System:  PSX
Type:    ?
Rarity:  Common
Notes:   I've only seen, and not played this game. I'm not even sure of 
the name. It appears in closeout bins quite a bit, so I've skipped it, 
and from all the feedback that I've heard, I've made the right choice.


Title:   Bust A Move 2 Dance Tengoku Mix
Company: Enix
System:  PSX
Type:    Dancing
Rarity:  Common
Notes:   Although not as good as the original, BAM2 refines the dancing 
system to near perfection. The big downfall is the songs, which have 
lost a bit of their edge from the first release. Again, good character 
design and a nice club feel to the graphics. Recommended.


Title:   Umjammer Lammy
Company: SCEI -NA, Europe, Japan-
System:  PSX
Type:    Guitar (in the style of Parappa)
Rarity:  Common (US), Uncommon (US)
Notes:   The pseudo-sequel to Parappa, Lammy adds much more variety to 
the mix, including 2 player (cooperative and versus), and versions of 
the songs that Lammy is joined by Parappa. Containing some of the same 
characters as Parappa and having the same graphical style, fans of 
Parappa will definately dig this one. And if you thought that some of 
Parappa's songs had odd topics... check out the storyline on this one. 
Sadly, the most bizzarre level in the game, Hell (the next-to-the-last 
stage), was changed in the US and European version (for obvious content 
reasons, and to avoid the 'M' rating that might have come with it...). 
Instead, Lammy plays (the same song) on a desert island. Does this meant 
ath Hell is really a tropical island? Hmmm... makes to think... Anyway, 
whether you're playing in Hell or a Desert Island, the game is 
Recommended.


Title:   Bust A Move Dance and Rhythm Action
Company: Atlus
System:  Arcade
Type:    Dancing
Rarity:  Uncommon
Notes:   The same as the Playstation version, BAM Arcade features a foot 
pad that you press instead of the down button, making what was once 
simple a tad bit harder. The attack/dodge button has been reduced to a 
single button (?) that I've never gotten to work. Maybe if I could read 
the instructions...


Title:   Stepping Stage Series
Company: Jaleco
System:  Arcade
Type:    Dancing
Rarity:  Uncommon+
Notes:   I've only just seen, and not played, this one. Similar to DDR, 
Stepping Stage uses 6  pads of 3 different colors. I've not even listed 
to the music, so I can't comment much...


Title:   Perfect Performers - The Yellow Monkey
Company: ?
System:  PSX
Type:    ?
Rarity:  Uncommon
Notes:   I've only seen ads for it, but it would appear to be a rhythm 
game in the style of Stolen Song, featuring music by The Yellow Monkey, 
a Japanese hair rock group. I'm going to skip it, personally....


Title:   PacaPacaPassion
Company: ?
System:  PSX
Type:    ?
Rarity:  Uncommon
Notes:   I've only seen, and not played this game. Any info would be 
helpful.


Title:   VJ
Company: Jaleco
System:  Arcade
Type:    Rave?
Rarity:  Rare-
Notes:   One of the reasons that Konami and Jaleco don't like each 
other... (Konami sued over the similarity to their own titles - more on 
this whole fiasco coming in it's own section in a later release) 


Title:   Goo!Goo! Soundy
Company: Konami
System:  PSX
Type:    Multi?/Breeding?
Rarity:  Common-
Notes:   I haven't heard much about this one, other than the fact that 
it's apparently a breeding sim crossed with a rhythm game that you can 
you the PSX BEMANI controllers with - any and all of them... hmmm... I'm 
curious, to say the least... 


Title:   Rock'n Tread Series
Company: Namco
System:  Arcade
Type:    Multi
Rarity:  Uncommon-
Notes:   Why?


Title:   Bust A Move 2 Dance Tengoku Mix
Company: Atlus, Enix
System:  Arcade
Type:    Dancing
Rarity:  Uncommon
Notes:   See the BaM 1 arcade version for notes...


Title:   Guitar Jam
Company: Namco
System:  Arcade
Type:    Guitar
Rarity:  Uncommon+
Notes:   A Guitar Freaks rip-off, but with a full pressure-sensitive 
guitar neck instead of three buttons.


Title:   Vib Ribbon
Company: SCEI
System:  PSX
Type:    Unknown
Rarity:  Common-
Notes:   An odd yet good one, Vib Ribbon features black and white line 
graphics (no polygons in sight). As a stick-figure walks over certain 
scribbles, you have to press the button that corresponds to the 
scribble. If there was ever a stylised game, this is most definately it. 
Released Dec. 9 '99.


Title:   Space Channel 5
Company: Sega
System:  Dreamcast
Type:    Dancing
Rarity:  --
Notes:   This one just plain scares me. From what I understand, it's 
similar to Bust-A-Move, but you're a reporter trying to get info from 
aliens on a spaceship? What, do you dance the facts out of them? (which 
wouldn't surprise me, as this is from the company that crossed a zombie 
shooting game with a typing tutor for the upcoming game The Typing of 
the Dead). Anyway, it plays a bit like Simon Says or Memory, where you 
have to mimic the moves that are shown to you... Release date is 
16dec99.


Title:   Puyo Puyo DA! -featuring ELLENA system-
Company: 
System:  Dreamcast
Type:    Dancing
Rarity:  --
Notes:   A dancing game featuring the Puyo Puyo characters. Decent 
looking.


Title:   Samba de Amigo
Company: Sega
System:  Arcade, possibly Dreamcast
Type:    Maracca
Rarity:  --
Notes:   Developed by Sonic Team (the team responsible for the Sonic the 
Hedgehog games [obviously], as well as NiGHTS), this one is definately 
odd looking, but is quite a blast to play... You have to shake the 
maraccas to the beat, and in certain places... Also, it's rumored that 
this game will eventually be ported to the Dreamcast, and will have a 
Maracca Controller released as well (this is almost a definate, as it 
runs on the Naomi board, which is the Dreamcast Arcade board - porting 
it would be simple). 


Title:   UmJammer Lammy
Company: Namco, SCEI
System:  Arcade
Type:    Guitar
Rarity:  --
Notes:   A conversion of the PSX game using a guitar controller 
interface instead of a normal button interface. The guitar features four 
buttons similar to the single guitar freaks one, where you 'strum' to 
press the button; each button bears one of the PSX symbols (X, O, ^, 
[]), so gameplay is unaltered. There is also a start button and a 'wail' 
slider.


Title:   Beat Planet Music
Company: SCEI
System:  PSX
Type:    Shooting/Music
Rarity:  --
Notes:   A cross between the Square art-shooter 'iS: internal section' 
and a music game. Heavily stylised, BPM allows you to create your own 
songs by picking up notes as you fly down a twisting corridor. Due for a 
Feb. 2000 release.
  

Title:   Audition
Company: Jaleco?
System:  Unknown
Type:    Singing?
Rarity:  --
Notes:   Not much is known about this title so far...
      --not yet released--

 
Title:   UniSon
Company: Jaleco?
System:  PS2
Type:    Singing/Dancing
Rarity:  --
Notes:
      --not yet released--


Title:   Bust A Move 3
Company: Enix
System:  PS2
Type:    Dancing
Rarity:  --
Notes:   No concrete info on this yet, except for the fact that it is 
coming.
     --not yet released--


Title:   ?
Company: Square
System:  PSX?, PS2?
Type:    ?
Rarity:  --
Notes:   Nothing is known yet about this game, other than the fact that 
Square (makers of Final Fantasy and other excellent RPGs) are making 
some sort of rhythm game. The platform will probably be one of the 
Playstation systems, but like I said, nothing is really known yet 
(including a release date...). More is likely to be announced at their 
Millenium Conference, to be held in January 2000.
     --not yet released--

v.1.00, so this is the last that I'll mention it.
  added more info on Beatmania around the world, and about the European 
  edit. also added some about the DC PnM controller. (great thanks to 
  h0l, who has been incredibly helpful). added modes for DS:TKD for 
  PSX. added two more artists (both real) to the artists list. added 
  the release date for DDRAppendTKD. added the BM GB password ALTERNA, 
  which opened another song unknown to me (e.n.k.), so that was added 
  to the songlist... added the possibility of Samba de Amigo on the DC. 
  added difficulty listing for Beatmania 4th and 5th Mixes. Added the 
  fact that Fatboy Slim and Moloko will be in the BM:European Edit 
  (from the OPM, UK).

ver.0.95.5a/0110999: still technically pre-release, but at this point,

  PnM info, including DC. added DJ Man info. added minimal info on the 
  3rd-party DDR controllers. still lots more to add, and not enough 
  time to add it... 

  note: I still have lots to add, but after realising that the release 
  that I thought had been released actually hadn't (which featured much 
  of the new release info like Rap Freaks and Drummania for PS2), I 
  figured that I should jet this out tonight... Please note that this 
  is a fairly incomplete release, and, for instance, credits people for 
  things that aren't in the document, etc... This should be fixed 
  shortly...

ver.0.95.5/150999: still technically pre-release.
  added more info on the 'another' versions of the songs in 4th Mix. 
  added info on Horrible Course and Bonus Course (both in Expert Mode) 
  in 4th Mix. added info on Internet Ranking for Append 4th Mix. added 
  a bit of info on Samba de Amigo. added songlist for DDR2ndReMix, 
  GFpsx, GFarc, DM, PnM (DC). added more info to the PnM song list. did 
  some misc. editorial/formatting corrections.

  added more info to the 4th mix songlist, as well as how to open bonus 
  edit mode.

ver.0.95a/100999: still technically pre-release.
  added and corrected to 4th mix expert stage flow. added info on 4th 
  mix secret mode (Another Course, Expert mode).

ver.0.95/090999: still technically pre-release.
  added all of the info for 4th mix. added more info on the song lists 
  for 3rd mix and gottamix. added some misc. info like release dates 
  and book publishers, and fixed some misc. problems/errors. added info 
  on BMgb2. added info on the Beatmania hidden modes. added more info 
  on the DJ Station PRO. added info on DDR DAM. added more info on 
  DDRsolo. fixed some grammatical stuff/spelling, and some errors. 
  added a quick guide to DDR and filled in a lot of info on the DDR 
  song list (ask on gamefaqs.com and you shall recieve - DDR was the 
  number 2 most wanted faq for the PSX on the faq request chart). added 
  arcade song lists for bmIIdxSubClubVer2, DDRsoloBassMix, and TKD. 
  added a lot of possibilities to the artists section (thanks to bill 
  for the info). added how to unlock the hidden PSX DDR songs and edit 
  mode. added a bit on info on the DDR append disc, and the PS2 
  Drummania. added stage flow for 3rd mix PSX. added info on Pop'n 
  Stage (why, God, why?). 

ver.0.89/240899: still technically pre-release.
  added info about the two WS hidden songs, and filled in the song 
  lists a bit more, as well as flow charts. Also updated the Artists 
  section with some info on who is actually who (from Beatmania Press   
  Guide), as well as info on Herbie Hancock/Hammock. Also added a bit   
  to the misc. section about Beatmania vs. Beat Mania, and about the 
  Tokimeki Memorial LCD game. Corrected spelling of 'syndrome' in first 
  sentence... Also, saw a preview copy of DDR2ndReMix in Laox the other 
  day and found that it has 29 songs, including BoomBoomDollar (my 
  personal favourite), as well as the incredibly over-played 
  Tubthumping by Chumbawumba... Added the number of songs to the BEMANI 
  release list, but haven't started a song list for it yet - it will 
  probably be a little while - too many other good games coming out 
  this month in both the US and Japan, including 4th Mix, Galerians, 
  Thousand Arms, and FFVIII - DDR2ndReMix has gotten pushed rather far 
  down on my personal list...

ver.0.88/230899: still technically pre-release.
  added a lot of info on GB, as well as some more to the song lists for 
  Gotta and WS. Working on filling in the blanks on the song lists... 
  corrected some misc. stuff... Also working on beginning to re-format 
  the doc, as well as creating smaller, release-specific FAQs, but this 
  is just in the planning stage... Also wondering if it is in fact too 
  sprawling, and not concentrated enough... I didn't quite realise how 
  much non-game stuff had gotten in there (like the histories, the 
  other games, the artist names, etc...)...

ver.0.87/200899: first public release, but still technically pre.
  cleaned up things a bit, added song lists and info on Beatmania GB, 
  corrected misc. info... still have some new non-BEMANI arcade games 
  to list, but it's almost 6am and I haven'd slep yet, so that's for 
  another time...

ver.0.85/060899: private beta release. still pre-release. 
  Still missing some song info on 3rd Mix, Gottamix, and DDR, as well 
  as the Expert Mode list and how to open the hidden songs on 3rd. 
  Music CDs are still very thin, and some of the info on the books and 
  LCD games are missing as well, as is the entire arcade game song
  lists. The first PSX release is pretty much complete, though, and 
  Gotta is getting there...

ver.pre/030899: Pre-release version/in-progress version. 
  Everything added.

_____DJ Syndrome; A Guide: 

...or a guide to the series of guides to BEMANI. As you may know, I've 
released not one, but multiple documents on the BEMANI series. This will 
merely show you what is out there...

Please note that this document is the main document - every other 
document is merely a pared down version of this one for one reason or 
another (usually-game specific), as I know that not everyone wants to 
download a 200k document, of which only perhaps 5% is really relevant 
for the game that they want.

I believe that all of the titles should be pretty obvious of the 
document's contents... All of the game specific titles include Stage 
Flow, Hidden Songs/Modes/Characters, Songlists, and any other 
information that is gameplay-relevant. All of the below FAQs can be 
found in their respective sections of www.gamefaqs.com (or just do a 
search by name).

_____Coming Later:

The following are things that I would like to include at a later date. 
No guarantees, though...:

- Song flow lists for the remanining non-Beatmania games
- All BEMANI song lists, including home, arcade, portable, & LCD games
- All BEMANI Music CDs
- Other BEMANI merchandise
- Trivial things like the different logos that appear on each Beatmania 
   arcade cabinet
- Info on the whole BEMANI-influenced legal battles with Konami, Namco, 
   and Jaleco... Can't we all just get along?
- Translated interviews from the the Beatmania/BEMANI guides (although 
   I can't do this on my own - anyone want to volunteer? I've got the 
   interviews that I can scan and send, I just need someone that can 
   read them...)
- More song lyrics
- Anything that has a ?

_____Dedications:

This document is dedicated to a couple of people who are dear to me: 
First, to my late Grandfather, who I unknowingly said goodbye for the 
last time when I left the US to come to Japan. Also, to ~E~, for 
everything. Lastly, to Amazing Curto, the flying monkey/bird/elephant 
hybrid thingie - better start practicing your Beatmania skills so you 
can put on a good show when you come to Japan...
