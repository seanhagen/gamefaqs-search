	I tried to combo with every special move in
the game, including the death moves. Some just come
out to slow to add to the combo. Anyways before
I list the combos I have to mention a completely
unique move in the game. The manual calls this move
a guard attack. What you do is guard an attack, any
attack, and before the attack hits push forward and
hit the A button. You will do an attack from a block
stun which has a few frames of animation that are 
invinsible! This is because you are still blocking.
This move works very good against rushing attacks and
attacks coming from the a different level (background
to foreground or foreground to backgroud). If you want
comfirmation on this move just attack the computer from
another level an it will use it on you.

If you get real good at this move you can do it before
a fast fireball hits you and the fireball will pass 
right through you.


Now on with the combos
---------------------------------------------------------------------
lp = light punch = A button
lk = light kick  = B button
hp = heavy punch = c button
hk = heavy kick  = D button

Kim Kap Hwan - The Tai Kwando Genius
-------------------------------------
"To let men in the world know of Tai Kwan Do...glorious"

(Kim has a kick with the c button where a hp would be, I refer to 
  this move as the c kick or ck)

	- flying hk + standing hk + cresent moon slash
            (his standing hk is an axe kick that hits twice you
             can buffer the special move after the first or second
             hit, changing it from a 3 hit to a 4 hit combo that
             will stun most of the time)

	- flying hk + lp + cresent moon slash
	- flying hk + lk + cresent moon slash 
	- standing lp + lp + lp + lp + cresent moon slash

                 can be ducking or standing, ie. guile combo)
	- flying hk + ducking lk + lk + flash kick (the same goes
                 for the last lk only it is more difficult)
	- flying hk + ck + flask kick (the ck can be ducking or
                 standing)
    *   - flying hk + axe kick + flurry of kicks (death move combo.
                 This combo will drain an opponent's full life bar
                 down to between a lp's amout or a hp's amout of
                 energy left and will stun, making this the only
                 true TOD of the game.)


Mai Shiranui - The Enchanting Ninja Maid
-----------------------------------------
"Andy is the ONLY one I hesitate to fight with..."

	- flying hk + lp + Ryuenbu (flame fandango)
	- flying hk + lk + Ryuenbu
	- flying hk + lp + Fan toss
	- flying hk + lk + Fan toss
	- lp + Flaming Tumbleweed (death move combo. The death
                   move can be blocked but it can't be countered,
                   so the blocked death move will hit 3 times
                   taking the total damage of a throw or more)
	- flying hk + Flaming Tumbleweed (the same goes for this one)


Tung Fu Rue - The Schiziod Martial Arts Old Guy
-----------------------------------------------
"With age comes wisdom, and with that comes my power."

( Treat the Lunge punge as you would Cammy's Cannon Drill, if
  blocked you can be thrown or comboed. So if you are going
  to use it in a combo make sure all previous attacks have hit)

	- flying hk + standing hk + Lunge punch
	- flying hk + standing hp + Lunge punch
	- flying hk + lk + lk + Lunge punch
	- standing lp + lp + lp + lp + ducking lp + Lunge punch
	- flying hk + lp + lp + lp + lp + Lunge punch
	- flying hk + lp + lp + hp + Lunge punch
	- flying hk + lp + hk + Lunge punch (The hk will hit twice

	- flying hk + lk + hk + Lunge punch (ditto)
	- flying hk + hp + Fireball (Shouha)
	- flying hk + hk + Fireball (Shouha)
	- Standing hk + Senpu-Gou-Ken (death move combo. The death
                     move can be blocked but not countered and will
                     more damage than Mai's blocked death move, I think)
	- flying hk + hp + Shenpu-Gou-Ken (same as previous combo)


Duck King - The Brutal Break Dancer
-----------------------------------
"So you wanna dance, huh?"

( The Beat Rush will hit up to 3 hits and the last 2 are blockable.
 The manual refers to the neele roll as \ + D, but this will do a
                                         0
 slide not a needle roll. The needle roll is | + D)
                                             0

	- Standing lp + lp + lp + Duck Roll
	- flying hk + duckking lk + Duck Roll

"Remember what they say, the third times a charm. Your time is up!"

	- standing hp + Club Spin (The hp is his pole vault kick and
                 must be done from a certain distance)
	- standing lp + Flaming Pole ( unsure about this one because
                 I'm not perfect with this move)


Axel Hawk - The Iron-Knuckled Pugilist
--------------------------------------

	- flying hp + lp + Axel Dance
	- standing bp + Axel Dance ( the bp will hit twice)
	- flying hp + standing bp + lp + Axel Dance
	- lp + Tornado Upper + Axel Dance (can be blocked, but it does
                  good damage if opponent is in the corner)

Laurence Blood - The Bloodthirsty Matador
-----------------------------------------
"The more blood I draw, the more fun I'll have."

	- flying hk + ducking lk + Bloody Spin
	- flying hk + standing hk + Bloody Sword
	- flying hk + standing hp + Bloody Spin
	- flying hk + standing hk + Bloody Spin
	- flying hk + standing hp + Bloody Sword (very powerful, but 
		   doesn't stun. If you do it to someone who is stunned
                   it is guaranteed to kill)
	- flying hk + ducking hp + Bloody Spin
	- flying hk + Bloody Flash ( Death move combo, very difficult)

Wolfgang Krauser - The Dreaded "Dark Kaiser"
--------------------------------------------
"Who comes next to be my goat?"

	- flying hk + lp + Leg Tomahawk
	- flying hk + lk + Leg Tomahawk
	- flying hk + standing hp + Leg Tomahawk
	- flying hk + ducking hp + Leg Tomahawk
	- flying hk + standing hk + Leg Tomahawk


Well there it is. I deleted several combos but nothing you can't find for
yourself. A lot are just different by a lk instead of a lp or a ducking
attack instead of a standing attack. I use flying hk to start most of the
combos off but hp works just as good for most people. Enjoy.
