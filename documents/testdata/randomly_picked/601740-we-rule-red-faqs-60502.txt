                 Modified this guide from my main We Rule guide (it's hardly
                 different) and submitted it. Here's a list of things that I
                 changed:
                 * Changed "We Rule" to "We Rule RED" in some places
                 * Changed download links to the one download link
                 * Added a "Why another version?" section

=======================
A. What is We Rule RED?
=======================

We Rule is a social kingdom game by developers ngmoco and Newtoy for iOS
devices. Players build and expand their kingdoms, making money with
businesses, farms, and help from other players.

We Rule RED is simply an alternate app for We Rule. It gives existing players
10 extra Mojo (see the "Why another version?" for more information).

========================
B. Downloading and Plus+
========================

Download We Rule RED from the iTunes App Store by simply searching for it, or
by downloading it from the link below:

http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/we-rule-red/id368843783?mt=8

Once you've downloaded We Rule RED, you need to log in to a Plus+ account.
Plus+ is a social gaming network (similar to Xbox Live) created by ngmoco. If
you already have an account, log in. If not, create an account and you can
begin.

=======================
C. Why another version?
=======================

There is already an app that is ALMOST identical to this one: the original We
Rule title for the iPhone.

For users, the main difference is that if you already have a We Rule kingdom,
installing We Rule RED gives players 10 extra Mojo.

ngmoco's reason for this is a bit more complicated. If the original We Rule
hits the top of the app lists, it'll be downloaded a lot, but will
eventually go off of those lists. We Rule RED is a new app that will attract
old players (for the free Mojo) to bump a We Rule title back up the charts.

===============
D. The tutorial
===============

Tap to enter your kingdom (it's on the left), and your tutorial will begin. Pay
attention to the tutorial -- this knowledge will be useful for the rest of the
game.

Objective: Build a Farm
-----------------------

Welcome to your kingdom! It's rather sparse right now, but in a few minutes,
it'll be beautiful. I promise.

You need to build a farm to get the ball rolling. Click on the Build menu at
the bottom-right (it's a picture of a hammer). In the menu that pops up, click
on "Farm" and place it somewhere in your kingdom by clicking the green button.

When you complete this first objective, you'll get 25 XP.

Objective: Harvest
------------------

After your farm has been built, you need to grow some crops in it. Tap your
newly-built farm and select the only product you can grow: corn.

Wait 45 seconds for it to grow. When it does, click on it to harvest the corn.
Each product gives you a certain amount of coins and XP; in corn's case, you
will get 5 coins and 1 XP.

After harvesting some corn, you'll get 500 coins and 25 XP (but just this once,
not every time you harvest corn).

Objective: Build more Farms
---------------------------

Like you did before, go back into the Build menu and select Farm. This time,
however, build two farms. You can place them wherever you want.

After building two farms, you'll get 40 XP.

You should also level up to Level 2. You should now be able to harvest Wheat,
build one more farm, and use 3 Mojo (which we'll learn about in a bit).

Objective: Use your Mojo
------------------------

Plant some Wheat in one of your farms. Wheat usually takes 5 minutes to
harvest, but we're going to use Mojo to speed it up. Click on the farm again
and click the blue "Use Mojo" button, and your crop will be harvested
instantly.

You'll receive 100 coins and 50 XP for completing this objective.

Objective: Decorate
-------------------

This next objective asks you to plant 5 pine trees. Go into the Build menu
and click on the green tree tab. The first item (and the only that isn't
locked) is the Pine Tree. Select it and build five of them anywhere in your
kingdom.

When you plant the trees, you'll get 50 XP.

You'll also level up, unlocking a number of things. Most notably, you'll now be
able to harvest onions and you'll also gain 4 Mojo.

Objective: Build a Cottage
--------------------------

This next objective will ask you to build a cottage. Unfortunately, you may not
have enough coins to do that (you need 100). To get that money, plant some
crops. If you're going to be actively playing for some time, Corn will yield
the most profit in the shortest time. However, if you're going to be away for
an hour, plant Onions. You could also plant Onions and use Mojo.

Once you have at least 100 coins, go into the Build menu and build an Orange
Cottage. Place it anywhere in your kingdom.

Building this cottage will give you 50 XP.

Objective: Collect Taxes
------------------------

The cottage will need to be constructed, which takes two minutes. But after
that, the people in your cottage will be "out laboring" for 4 hours. When they
return, you can collect taxes.

Go do something else for 4 hours. If you want, plant some Onions, let them
grow, and then come back in an hour.

Collecting these taxes will give you 50 XP.

Objective: The Social Map
-------------------------

This objective will take you back to the "Social Map," where you can see the
kingdoms of all your We Rule friends.

If you don't have any friends, you can invite some or check the myriad "add me"
threads on various message boards (GameFAQs is one of them). To add someone,
go to the Social Map and click the Plus+ icon at the top. The Plus+ interface
will appear. Go to the Friends tab at the middle of the bottom. Click the + at
the top-right to add a friend.

Once you visit someone else's kingdom, come back to yours and you'll receive
100 XP.

Objective: Expand your Kingdom
------------------------------

If you've reached Level 4 (which you probably have), you can upgrade your
kingdom and your castle. This costs 750 coins. It'll take awhile, but you can
farm your way there. You may wish to buy another farm to speed up your farming.

When you have enough money, go to the Build menu and click on the gray castle
tab. Doing this will expand your kingdom by 30%, give you a prettier castle,
and 100 XP.

Objective: Hire your Friend
---------------------------

You'll need to go back to the Social Map for this one. Go look for a kingdom
that has an "Open" sign over it. In that kingdom, there should be a building
with the same sign. Click on that building and order their services.

Return to your kingdom and receive 1000 coins and 300 XP.

And that's the whole tutorial! You're done.

Farming is a good way to make money and gain XP. You have a variety of crops to
choose from, with varying harvest times and profits to be made.

=============
A. In general
=============

Here are some general tips for making farming awesome:

* Always maximize the number of farms that you have.

* If you're playing actively, Corn gives the most coins. Wheat gives the most
  XP.

* Try to have something growing at all times. If you're coming back in five
  minutes, grow Wheat. If you're going to sleep, grow Potatoes or Oats. Don't
  rework your real life around We Rule, though. Because that makes you too
  obsessed.

* There's a great web app, accessible from a desktop computer, iPhone, iPod
  Touch, or iPad. It's called CropCalc, and it figures out the best crop to
  harvest based upon what level you're at and when you're available to play.
  Use it when deciding what crops to crow (if you're not sure).
  http://werule.moodbenders.nl/

=============
B. Crop chart
=============

Here is a list of crops and data about them. You can analyze this data, but
you could also just use CropCalc: http://werule.moodbenders.nl/

   | Pineapples   | 23   | 70   | 15h  | 305    | 130 | 20       | 8.667 |
   | Tomato       | 24   | 20   | 30m  | 95     | 35  | 190      | 70    |
   | Radishes     | 25   | 50   | 5h   | 200    | 85  | 40       | 17    |
   '--------------'------------------------------------------------------'

We see that, in general, shorter times means more coins per hour and more XP
per hour. Wheat is best for XP, and Corn is best for money.

There are a variety of businesses available in We Rule, from Tailor Shops to
Windmills to Dragon's Lairs. Players can order services from other players,
giving both of them coins and XP.

=============================
A. Making your own businesses
=============================

Making your own businesses is fairly simple -- simply enter the Build menu and
make a business. After it's constructed, it's ready for action!

In general, it is best to create businesses that cost more. While they may set
you back a lot, they pay themselves back very quickly, especially when other
players order from you. The more expensive the business, the more money and XP
you can make.

After you make these businesses, make sure you've got some buddies on Plus+ to
order from you. You make much more money and XP when other players order from
you than if they don't (though you still do make some money and XP).

=======================
B. Ordering from others
=======================

Go to the Social map and look for other kingdoms that have an "Open" sign on
them. Order from their businesses. This benefits them and you -- do it!

It's always a good idea to order from businesses that give you the highest
coins and XP.

================
A. What is Mojo?
================

Mojo is a magical liquid that speeds things up. Construction, business orders,
and crop-growing can take hours. If you use Mojo, it can be completed in
seconds.

=======================
B. How do you get Mojo?
=======================

You can get Mojo in one of three ways:

1. Buying it from the Mojo Store (see section below) using real money.

2. Get it when you level up.

3. Get it from downloading "special offers" applications, which will be
   advertised on login. These apps are usually free, so if you'd like some
   Mojo, this is a great way to get it.

==============
C. Buying Mojo
==============

If you want to spend your real-life money on Mojo, go for it. In general, the
best value is the higher amounts of Mojo, though you may not want that much.

I've never spent a dime on Mojo, so don't feel like you have to. I don't often
use Mojo, so there's no need for me to buy it.

Here a chart showing the cost of Mojo, the amount you get, and the cost per
Mojo, in US Dollars:

                  .----------------------------------------.
                  | Name    | Amount | Cost   | $ per Mojo |
                  |----------------------------------------|
                  | Flask   | 30     | $4.99  | $0.17      |
                  | Bottle  | 75     | $9.99  | $0.13      |
                  | Carafe  | 165    | $19.99 | $0.12      |
                  | Case    | 300    | $29.99 | $0.10      |
                  | Vintage | 800    | $49.99 | $0.06      |
                  '----------------------------------------'

We see that the best deals are on the more expensive containers.

Once again, don't feel that you have to pay for it to do well in the game -- I
seldom USE Mojo, let alone buying it.

Realms are a rather new addition to We Rule. They allow the player to expand
their land into another, separate area. They are then accessed by clicking on
an arrow on the edge of your main realm.

The first realm (the South Realm) is unlocked at level 15, and is free. The
other compass directions are unlocked at levels 20, 25, and 30, and each cost
150,000 coins. You can later expand them for more coins.

Realms have the advantage that they give the player more land. They have the
disadvantage, however, that lazy neighbors won't go to your realm to order from
your businesses. I'd recommend putting your decorations and farms there, and
other things that don't require other players (such as Cottages).

At the moment, you cannot move buildings/etc from one realm to the other. It
was said in the following tweet from @WeRuleGame:

  " Currently things can't be moved from one Realm to another for all those "
                asking. You'll need to raise new structures!

Awards
------

There are a bunch of Awards that you can get in We Rule. You can see them by
going to the Plus+ menu at the top-right. Each award gives your Plus+ profile
more points, but that's all it does.
