Section A--Story 
***********************************************************************

 The 22nd Century... Mankind has succeeded in his dream of developing a 
natural, limitless energy supply. It was the dawning of the Age of 
Magic.
 Science and industry, the source of enviromental pollution and weapons 
of mass destruction, were outlawed. This controversial decision was to 
bring history as mankind knew it to an end...
 However, the abolition of technology did little to soothe mankind's 
suffering. A war erupted, fueled by fearsome weapons based on rapidly 
developing magical theory. Eventually, shockingly powerful biological 
weapons were produced by fusing human and animal DNA with magic, 
resulting in a horrible mix of vitality and raw strength. This was the 
birth of the Gears.
 The powerful military state that produced the Gears monopolized the 
manufacturing process, bringing countless other lands under its control. 
These Gears were designed to be litle more than slaves, incapable of 
independant thought. Yet from among their ranks a rebel appeared, 
announcing himself to be self-aware. This insurrectionist, calling 
himself Justice, gathered an army of fellow Gears and declared war on 
all mankind. Despite heavy initial casualties to these renegade Gears, 
the humans put their differences aside and formed an elite group of 
warriors to combat the Gear menace. This group of brave heroes became 
know as the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. One hundred years of brutal 
war later...
 The fierce battle between the Gears and the humans, which had become 
known as the Crusades, was finally at an end. The heroic Sacred Order 
had sealed Justice inside an impenetrable dimensional prison, and it was 
only a matter of time before the remaining masterless Gears were rounded 
up and destroyed.
 However, five years after the end of the Crusades, the walls of 
Justice's dimensional prison have unexpectedly begun to erode away. 
Assessing the threat before them, the world's leaders quickly organize 
an internalional fighting tournament to select members for a proposed 
Second Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Astoundingly, the prize for this 
tournament was said to be literally anything one desired: The victor 
would get to make a single wish... any wish at all.
 Yet in the panic surrounding the imminent decay of Justice's 
dimensional prison, few seemed to take notice of the rather suspicious 
rules of this tournament, such as the welcoming of criminals, and the 
permission to shed blood during the matches...

Section C--Credit
************************************************************************
 This is my first attempt at creating a faq. I have done all I could to 
make this as detailed as possible so that you will not have any 
difficulties playing and enjoying this game. I would like to thank Atlus 
for publishing Guilty Gear they made an awesome choice, and I hope that 
Arc Systems and Team Neo Blood create a second installment.

************************************************************************
Section D--Instant Kill and Codes
************************************************************************
Note:Do not learn, but master the Instant Kill move and how to evade it,      
god knows how many times I fell victum to the Computer.

Instant Kill-Works with all characters

Press P + K (Close to opponent) Screen will flash Red
      In this instant(during Red screen) press
      D,DF,F + P + K if it connects you will know

To evade the Instant Kill

      When the screen turn Red(from your opponents actions)
      Quickly do the instant kill backwards
      D, DB,B + P + K

Codes-How to Obtain Justice, Testament and Baiken without beating the                   
game.

      When you first boot the game, andthe white "Sony" screen appears, 
hold (Down + Square + L1 + R2) and keep them down throughout the booting 
process up until the message "Team neo blood" fades out. When you start 
the game, Testament, Justice and Baiken will be unlocked without you 
needing to finish the game. 

Note: This Code does work, instead of revealing the Secret characters,it  
instead puts the game in HARD mode, which you will see blinking on the 
bottom of every match. Believe me, its suicide playing in this mode. I 
have not once been able to get it to work and believe its a lie. Even my 
friends cannot get it to work. Some joke huh? To find out how to get the 
characters the hard way goto the bottom of the faq.

Basic Strategies
************************************************************************
This is just an overall way to beat the computer if its being cheap 
towards you. In future updates I hope to include boss meetings(Rivals 
ect.. you meet before the end)and Individual Strategies to beating 
them(They are usually the hardest to defeat).

1.)If your ever in a corner, GET OUT!, that is the worst spot to be in,    
try to lead the computer there and knock a few hits off. Repeat if       
its a cheap character(Justice anyone?)

2.)If the computer makes the screen flash Red, quickly use the reverse    
Instant kill to evade his attack, and try to reverse it onto him.    
Chances are you can probably pull it off since he is in a vulnerable    
state.

3.)When Fighting Sol, never stay on the ground. Stay in the air and    
slash attack him. Repeat but never get to close, since he will    
attempt the instant kill. Watch out for his Riot Stamp since that is       
his basic strategy next to his supers.

4.)When going against Justice, jump attack him and when you connect with 
the hit and land immediatly do a combo attack. You will do incredible 
amounts of damage to him. If the air attack doesn't connect get away 
from him as fast as you can and try to repeat it. NEVER EVER STAY CLOSE 
TO HIM, or too far away or he will use his massively cheap super giga 
laser on you.
