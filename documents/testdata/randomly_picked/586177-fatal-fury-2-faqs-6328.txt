12/20/99 - vERSION 0.0: Started my sixth FAQ and this time it's my first character 
guide. 

01/18/03 - vERSION 0.1: VERY small update, only a few edits - nothing added.

  I decided to write this Mai Shiranui Character Guide because first off I've 
never done one, second I really liked Mai when I saw her on Samurai Showdown 
(SNES, Cameo appearance or even possibly as a secret character!), and third she 
just looks like a good all around character. As more updates come, I hope that this Guide 
will be more indepth, complete, and full or facts about this character. In the 
mean time, Enjoy!
