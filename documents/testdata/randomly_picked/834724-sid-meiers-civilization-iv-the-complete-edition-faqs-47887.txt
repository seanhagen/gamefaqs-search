------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2.01] The World

As you would see, the world in Civilisation IV is able to be created by you.
You can choose to create a world of your own choosing. 

Terra worlds are those worlds that are similar to Earth. It will consist of
large and small land masses with all types of terrain. 

Continential worlds are simply two or more large landmasses seperated by
water. A navy is a must here.

Archipelago worlds are harder than most maps because they feature more small
islands isolated by oceans. A navy is needed for survival.

Pangaea worlds are just one single landmass surrounded by a ocean. You want
a place next to the ocean since being landlocked is quite dangerous but being
near the coast needs a navy. 

Ice age is one of the hardest simply because there is not a lot of resources
for you to develop on. Fights of resource rich areas are a common sight.

Oasis worlds are large landmasses with lots and lots of deserts with the
oasis to provide water for food. Quite difficult for a beginner.

Lake worlds is similar to Pangaea but it contains a large amount of lakes on
the landmass.

The size of the map is also important. The order is set from Duel to Huge. 
Please note that the upper options such as Duel and Small are for small 
matches, not for 12 civs to fight it out. And vice versa, don't have 3 civs
fighting on a Huge map. There would be a lot of micro needed. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2.02] The Climate

The climate is another thing you need to know. This will effect on the 
terrain and the resources available here that you can procure. 

Temperate is the average climate here. It consists of all terrain, from grass
land to desert to tundra. There is a good mix and all resources would appear.

Tropical is where the climate is warmer, leading to more jungles at the 
expense of tundra. Bear in mind that fur and deers tend to appear on tundra.

Arid is where the climate is dry, leading to more deserts at the expense of
lakes and rivers. It would be harder to plant crops and find crop boosters 
here.

Rocky is where there would be lots of hills and peaks, making it lovely for
hammer production, but at the expense of lowland areas for planting crops for
the cities. 

Cold is the opposite of temperate where the world would be covered in more
tundra at the expense of deserts and jungles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.01] Food

Lets face it, Cities need food to survive. For a larger city, it would need
more food than a small city before there are evidently, more people. A city
can harvest food from tiles that are within their city boundaries.

Every turn, a "person" will need to consume two food to survive and produce
resources for the city. When the city has an excess of food, where there is 
more production of food than consumption, the city will store food. The city
will store the food in slowly build up to create another worker for the city. 
The time needed to create another worker can be seen in the Food Bar in the
city screen, which is below the population of your city. Once the food bar is
filled, there would be a new worker and the food bar is reset. However, if you
have a granary in your city, half of the food used to create a new worker, 
will be stored for the next worker. 

However, it is possible to have a shortage of food. When this happens, the
food stored in the food bar will decrease, which you can see with the red
slide back. Once the bar is completely empty, one population point will be
deducted from your total as people are starving. This will continue until you
develop enough food to sustain and support your population. 

The best ways to have a large food input is to quickly develop food resources
that are near you. Corn, wheat, rice, pig, sheep, cow, deer are quick basic
sources of food for you. Farm, pastures and camps these resources. Grassland
is the best place to farm since it provides a +2 bonus to food. Flood plains
are also food but will deduct from the health total. This is all found on 
land. Deer are mainly found in the tundra area as well. Another point worth
noting is that being next to fresh water for any of the above resources will
provide a +1 food bonus, and this bonus also applies to farms as well. 

In the sea, fish, clams and crabs are the basic sources of food. Each ocean
tile produces +2 food, with clams and crabs giving +2 when improved and fish
+3. It would be handy for a coastal city to position itself where there is 
nearby access. The lighthouse building also adds +1 food production in water
tiles. 

On the city screen, food per tile is represented by a slice of bread. One 
slice of bread means that the tile is producing one unit of food. A bread loaf
means that it is producting 5 units of food, making these places a must have
for any city. 

Health of a city also has an effect on your city's consumption of food. If 
your city is unhealthy, for every point of unhealthlyness (or those who can't
figure it out, it is for every cross < sick green face), your city will 
consume an extra food unit per turn. This can add up so make sure it is 
healthy while it is growing. 

Your Government Economic Civic can also be a factor. If you use the State
Property civic, you get an extra +1 food production from the workshop and
watermill improvement. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.02] Production

After you finish worrying about the food in the city, you city has to 
develop improvements or build units. Those items can only be produced by
production, or hammers or to long time players, Shields (hehe, Civ 2). When
you choose to produce something in a city, the production of the city can be
seen under the food bar. On the main screen, it is the second bar, the blue
one, with orange being food and growth. On the city screen, the Production
Bar is the one below the food bar. This details how many more turns it will
require, what you are producing, and the amount of hammers you are producing
per turn. When you establish a city, you will be prompted on what to build. 
After the completion of a project, the prompt screen will show on what to 
build next. 

You cannot have a shortage of hammers, like you can in food. However, if you
delay a project too long, the hammers will start to decay a little. To have
hammers, you can develop upon certain tiles. Plains, hills and forests are 
the best place to start on developing, with upgrades of a mine to boost it.
Later on, you can build lumbermills, workshops, mills and such to boost your
production. Resources will also boost production with resources like stone
and marble available to quarry, iron, copper to mine. Later in the game, you
have more access to production resources such as coal and aluminum. 

What the old Civilisation players will realise is that the production bar
doesn't carry over when you change what you are producing. Lets take for 
example you are building a barracks. You are halfway there when you realise 
that you need a worker. So you change production to worker, but the hammers 
from the granary doesn't carry over. You have to start anew when you change
production. But don't worry, the production bar for the barracks will stay
the same, like your construction of the barracks on hold or something like 
that. 

You can also hurry the production of the production bar to finish the 
production of the product. There are several methods of hurrying the 
production. Some are permanent such a Forge which will increase productivity
by 25% or Wonders such as the Three Gorges Dam, which increases productivity
by 10%. You can also train engineers who will produce +2 hammers per turn. 
Or you can sacrifice great engineers who will add a large amount of hammers
to the current project. 

Several civics will influence the production of your city. Universal Suffrage
is the best civic since it will allow +1 production from a developed cottage
which is called a town. It also allows you to pay gold to hurry the project. 
The amount of gold you have to pay is dependent on the amount of hammers 
still needed. This can be done if you have the gold and click hurry 
production on the city management menu, which is next to the build menu on 
the right and is the upper right button. 

Slavery will allow you to sacrifice population points to complete a project
but remember, you can't get those people back, they have to grow back via the
food bar. Bureaucracy will increase productivity and commerce in your capital
by 50%. Organised Religion will allow a 25% bonus in productivity in a city
where the state religion is present. 

The amount of productivity on a square is monitored by the amount of hammers
on that square. One hammer means one point productivity per turn while the
anvil means 5 units of productivity per turn. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.03] Commerce and Wealth

Before I start this topic, one thing has to be clear here, commerce is your
wealth. Commerce will turn into wealth after you pay your obligations. The
amount of wealth that is generated by commerce is dependant on your choice,
Commerce can be sent to become research, culture or wealth. 

Commerce is the lifeblood of your cities. It pays the maintain your people,
to pay your people and your standing army. It also pays for items you don't
have that others do, and to protect yourself from wars, or stop other wars. 
As they say, money talks. 

Commerce is developed from several sources. The most important is from the 
land or in some cases, the sea. The coasts and the ocean both produce commerce
initially as well as the terrain feature of the oasis. Also, the resources
that spread all over the terrain also provide commerce. The one you really
want is gold, gems or incense. The latter you have to research Calendar to 
develop upon. Rivers will give extra commerce to grassland terrain as well.
Some improvements such as cottages will generate commerce. Cottages will 
slowly provide +1 commerce but once it slowly develops into a town, it will
provide up to a +7 commerce bonus. 

Civics will also help you generate commerce. Bureaucracy will help you 
generate 50% more commerce in your capital city alone, Free Speech will 
provide towns to give you +2 commerce per turn. Buildings can also help you
generate commerce with buildings such as grocers and markets providing more
gold. Wonders can also generate commerce such as the Colossus which generates 
one more commerce on water tiles. 

Tribal villages will sometimes give a gift of gold to removing them from the
map. Pillaging a tile will also provide gold but you will destroy that 
improvement. Towns are the best to pillage as they provide upwards of 20 gold.
When you are at war, if you capture an enemy city, you will seize the gold
in that city. A large developed city will provide enormous amounts of wealth.

Trade routes will also generate gold. Trade routes are routes where you trade
with your own cities or foreign cities. The most profitable routes will be 
used to provide commerce. The amount of gold depends on the size and resources
of the trading city. Once your nation signs the open border treaty, you will
be able to trade with that country, allowing for profitable routes to develop
at once. Buildings, wonders, technologies and civics will have an influence
on the amount of trade routes that you can have while other buildings such
as the harbour will increase the income generated from trade routes. The 
income of the trade routes will add to your base commerce in that city. Note
that you have to have some way to trade, such as a river, road, sea, air. 

Merchants will generate money for you. They provide 3 gold every turn. If you
decide to sacrifice a great merchant, they will provide 6 gold for you every
turn. The merchants also can Conduct Trade Missions in a city. By sacrificing
themselves in a foreign city, they will generate large sums of gold depending
on the size, length and wealth of the target city. 

The final way is to use diplomatic channels to acquire wealth. You can trade
resources which you have and they don't for gold, technologies, cities, 
treaties and even the world map for money. Be careful what you trade though. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.04] Using Wealth

The continuation of the last topic, mainly because it was getting long and it
was only half way. Anyway, there are many ways that you have to spend your 
wealth in this game.

The first way to spend your wealth is maintenance of your city. This is 
automatic and cannot be changed. The amount of maintenance that your city
has to pay depends on several factors. The size of the population in that
city, the distance away from the Palace and the number of cities that you have
in your empire. This is automatic and is deducted automatically and cannot
be increased or decreased. 

The civic that you have chosen to adopt will also influence the amount of
gold you have to expend. When you choose your civic, there will be a listing
on how high the upkeep of the civic is. The higher the upkeep, the higher
some of gold per turn you have to pay. The amount you have to pay is also
dependant on the size and population of your empire. Also, you have to spend
gold on hurrying producting if you are using the Universal Suffrage civic.

There will also be inflation in the game. This is represented by the 
continued growth and size and therefore, it becomes more expensive to 
maintain. You have to develop more wealth or expand your empire to counteract
this problem. 

The amount of commerce you spend on research and culture will reduce the 
amount of wealth you would receive. The more on research, the less on wealth
and so forth. 

Your units sometimes require upkeep due to the use of some civics. This will
be a drain on your. Also, upgrading your units into stronger units will also
cost you gold to upgrade. For example, you upgrade an archer into a cross-
bowman, it will cost you to upgrade. 

Diplomacy is the final way to rid yourself of wealth. You might have to pay
for many things, such as resources, technologies, peace, treaties or just
bribes to keep them happy. Like I said above, money talks. 

If you run out of money, your cities will go on strike, after all, no one
wants to work for free. They will ruin the city and not produce anything
till you get your financial state into a better condition. At this stage, it
might be advisable to figure out what is wrong and do a check on the other
civs. Lower costs by now is a must. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.05] Culture

Culture in Civilsation IV refers to a Civilisation's accomplishments in the
field of literature, the arts, music, movies, etc. Each city has their own
culture level, defining the refinement and intellect of each city. Those 
cities that have a higher culture value do better than their less 
intellectual neighbours and hence, control land that is being divided between
the two. Culture is always represented as the purple musical note.

Culture is generated in many ways. You will find that in the establishment of
a city, the population would be more focused on surviving than producing fine
art, so it doesn't develop any culture. Once you start building some buildings
what generate culture, it would develop more culture. The most common form of
generating is through buildings. Once you have developed the Drama technology,
the culture bar will allow you to develop commerce into culture. This is 
allowing you to shift commerce from wealth and research to develop culture. 
The development of the music technology will allow all your cities to build
culture. This will allow you to set individual cities to develop culture.

Another form of generating culture is by building Wonders, which has a larger
Culture generation rate than normal buildings. The Specialists in the cities
can also generate Culture for you. An Artist will generate 4, a great artist
will generate 12. Of course, you can use the one off ability of a Great 
Artist, which is create a Major Work for a city (the one they are in). This 
will give the massive one off boost of 2000 to 6000 culture points. The amount
depends on the mode you are playing in. However, you will sacrifice the Great 
Artist by creating a Major Work. 

Culture also gives a defensive bonus to units fortified in the city. This is
because enemy soldiers will find it hard to attack a great city of such
beauty. Culture also rules how much land you can control. The more culture a 
city has, the more land that city can dominate over another city. If there is
an opponent, who has a city, the land may be contested. The person who has 
more cultural influence will control the land. You need at least 51% cultural
influence on the land to be your. Sometimes, your culture may be so great that
you may surround someone else's city. Soon, when your cultural influence 
becomes extremely high, the city will revolt. The ownership of the land will
return to the original owner but a second cultural revolution will allow the
city to change hands, allowing you to keep or pillage the town. 

There are several levels of culture. After reaching a certain amount of 
culture points, your cultural boundaries will expand. Below will show what 
level means what size.

If you look from the side, it sort of looks like an eye. 

As a minor point, Barbarian land is consider land and therefore, it can be
subjected to cultural boundaries. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.06] Happiness

Happiness is what drives the citizens asnd denizens of your cities to work.
Even if you are a harsh slave driver, you have to make your citizens happy
to work. If the citizens are happy, they will work, if they are unhappy, they
won't work. 

An unhappy citizen in a city is caused when you have more red angry faces than
happy yellow faces. An unhappy citizen will consume 2 food per turn like any
other population point, but they do not provide any output whatsoever. This
will prove to be a drain on a city as they will lower output and can lead to
non productive farms, mines and so on. This can sometimes lead to lower output
in production, commerce and sometimes, starvation. This can prove to be a 
massive problem. The best way to stop unhappiness getting out of control. you
should limit the growth or get some specialists.

There is one chronic cause of unhappiness. That is overcrowding your cities.
You will get one angry face for every population point that you have. This is
always present and you cannot get rid of it. There is no solution, so you have
to work around this. 

Another factor is war weariness. This is when your nation is at war with 
another nation and the war keeps dragging on. This only occurs when your 
nation is at war so try to avoid war. Also, the recently captured cities that
you have gained from the war would definitely be suffering from this because
the saw lots of people die, and aren't too pleased over it.

Being weaker in terms of Culture will be a problem. Sometimes, they will
want to join the Motherland, which means that there is a nearby foreign city
that is culturally superior to your city. 

Being Undefended by any military units will cause Unhappiness. This can only
be solved by stationing military units there. This will cause more problems
during wars, especially if you are fighting a war with a nation which borders
your nation. 

Your Civics can also become a factor. Slavery is not really nice, no citizen
likes being sacrificed to get the job done faster. The nationhood civic is no
different either. No citizen wants to be conscripted in to the army. Also, if
you don't have Emancipation as your civic and other countries do, you will
suffer one unhappiness because you don't have it. 

As there is unhappiness in a city, you will get an angry face when you see the
city on the main map.

There are several ways to obtain happiness in the city. 
Buildings are the main way to increase the happiness. Such buildings such as
the Collessum and the Theatre will provide happiness towarsd your city. These
are permanent effects upon your city, unless the improvement is destroyed.
Jails will also eliminate some unhappiness caused from war. 

Resources are another way to increase the happiness in your city. Many, many
resources will provide happiness to every city, provided there is access to
that resource. Most of these items are luxary resources such as gold, silver
and gems but also sugar, spice and wine. This effect can be doubled when
you develop some buildings such as a forge and a theatre.

Religion and Religious buildings are good sources of happiness. When you have
a state religion, you gain +1 Happiness in cities that have that religion
in their society. Religious buildings also help by providing +1 Happiness for
that religion.

Wonders can work wonders for happiness. Most wonders will make more people
happy in the city. Religious wonders will provide +1 Happiness from Incense. 
One national wonder is the Globe Theatre, which will eliminate all unhappiness
from the city it is built it. You can only have 1 though.

Civics will provide happiness for you. Free Religion will provide +1 Happiness
in a city for every religion. Hereditary Rule will provide +1 Happiness for 
every military unit stationed in the city. The Police State will also remove
50% of war weariness in cities. 

Culture can also make people happy. Once you research Drama, if you devote a
certain amount of commerce to Culture, you will receive some happy people for
it. Some buildings such as broadcast towers and theatres will even enhance
this cultural rate even more. 

One technology will enhance it even more. Future Tech will increase happiness
by one everytime it is researched. And you can keep researching it forver. 
With this tech, soon, Unhappiness will be obsolete. 

If you have more happy faces than the angry faces, your city is happy and
pleased by your performance. However, if there are more angry faces than there
are happy faces, then you must do something about the happiness of your
city. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.07] Health

The health of a city is important and vital to its growth. A city which is
healthy will grow better than a unhealthy one which will linguish. The point
of healthiness is that a unhealthy citizen will consume one more food that 
usual because of the upkeep. This might mean the difference between growth
and decay. 

There are several causes of unhealthiness. The first main contributor is the
use of factories and power plants. Some buildings in your cities will pollute
while in the job of providing benefits. For example, the coal power plant will
pollute 2 unhealthy points per turn while giving a 50% boost to hammer 
production. 

The next contribution to unhealthiness is the terrain. If you situate yourself
next to a flood plain or a jungle, it will be less healthy than building on
a grassland. Also, nuclear fallout isn't exactly healthy for any city, so
that might need to be worked with.

The largest contributor to unhealthiness is the population. Every population
point will contribute one point to unhealthiness. This cannot be changed and 
is just like happiness. 

There are many more ways to improve the health of the city.

The first is the difficulty you are playing on. The lower difficulties will
only provide 3, the medium ones 2, and the hardest one, only 1 bonus to
health. 

The next source is from wonders and buildings. Some wonders will improve the
health of the city or empire, such as the Hanging Gardens. Some buildings will
provide bonuses, such as the aqueduct providing 2 health or eliminate sources
of pollution, such as a recycling centre which removes all unhealthiness 
produced by buildings.

Resources will also provide health benefits. Some food resources such as fish,
clams, crabs, wheat, corn and rice will provide +1 health bonuses when they
are improved. Some buildings such as the harbour and the supermarket will
double this bonus. 

The next source is from forests. They will provide a extra boost to your
city's health as well as fresh water. 

The final source is from your civics. The Environmentalism civic will give a
massive +6 boost to Health in all cities. 

The secret boost to improve health is researching Future Tech which produces 
1 health boost every time it is researched. And it can be researched till the
cows come home. 

The health of a city is represented by the Red Cross icon and the un-
healthiness of the city is represented by Mr Green Sick face. It is measured 
by the number of points for and against. If you have more red crosses than 
sick faces, the city is healthy. If there are more sick faces than red
crosses, the city is unhealthy. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.08] Specialists

When any city is developed, the city must work on the basics of survival. As
the city grows larger, the city can devote some of its population to become
specialised in some tasks. They will perform these tasks better than normal
citizens can perform these tasks. The use of these specialists will allow
the city to engage in more rewarding goals.

When you want to employ a specialist, you must open the city screen and go
to the lower right hand side where you can see some faces. Ignore the ones
with the stars for the time being. Those faces represent the specialists that
you can hire. When you hire a specialist, you will lose a worker from the 
field to become a specialist. Be careful when hiring specialists since it 
might lead to a food shortage and we don't want that now do we?

You city can use up to 20 squares on the map within the city radius. Remember,
only up to 20 squares. The rest will be sent to become specialists. If there
are no spots open in the other professions, the citizen profession will be
chosen. You can open up the other specialist professions by building certain
buildings and wonders, as well as your civics. Bear in mind that your
specialists still consume food, drain your health and your happiness factors
as well. Because these guys still consume food, your cities that are rich
in food will have many specialists while a city struggling with food will
probably have no specialists. 

Once a city has drained all available land that it can use, the city will
automatically create specialists. Bear in mind, if you have survived this
long, either it is a non-military victory target or the other player, AI, has
absolutely no luck in finding you. And by this time, its time to get your 
ICBMs to be ready to fire. 

The most basic specialist is the citizen. He is probably the most useless
and you don't want to convert a worker in the field to this guy. This guy
only produces 1 hammer per turn. Heck, I can produce more in a cottage or a
hamlet than this guy. However, his guy is a prerequisite for the other 
professions, so sooner or later, you have to use him. The good thing is that
you can have as many as you want, and you need to meet no requirements to 
have these guys. 

Artist
The Artist is your next specialist. He is far more handy than your average
citizen. Every turn, his guy will produce 1 research point to your research 
and 4 culture points for the city. He also adds +3 to the Great Person 
growth rate. This is one of the more useful specialists. They will also make
the next Great Person spawned more likely to be a Great Artist.

Note for Following Tables
(NW) = National Wonder
(WW) = World Wonder
(SW) = Special Wonder

Buildings that will allow you to have Artists:
Broadcast Tower    : 2 Citizens  =   1 Artist
Theatre            : 1 Citizen   =   1 Artist
Globe Theatre (NW) : 3 Citizens  =   1 Artist

Engineer
The Engineer is not as useful as the Artist, but still nice when you have
run out of production slots. This guy will grant you 2 Hammers per turn and
add +3 to your Great Person Growth Rate. Once you have an Engineer, you will
be more likely to spawn a Great Engineer from the city.

Buildings that will allow you to have Engineers:
Factory            : 2 Citizens  =   1 Engineer
Forge              : 1 Citizen   =   1 Engineer
Ironworks (NW)     : 3 Citizens  =   1 Engineer

Merchant
The Merchant will be your mini-money-maker. They don't rake in tons of money
but someone for nothing is still better than nothing for nothing. Every turn,
he will generate 3 gold towards your city for free, or for 2 food. He will
also generate +3 Great Person points towards your city and increases the 
chances of a Great Merchant spawning in your city.

Buildings that will allow you to have Merchants:
Grocer             : 2 Citizens  =   1 Merchant
Market             : 2 Citizens  =   1 Merchant
Wall Street (NW)   : 3 Citizens  =   1 Merchant

Priest
The Priest is the holy man, and he is the easiest Specialist to generate 
because of the amount of buildings that can produce him. Every turn, he will
produce 1 Hammer and 1 Gold towards your city. He will also generate +3 Great
Persons points towards your city. This will also increase the chance of your
city generating a Great Prophet when it next spawns a Great Person.

Buildings that will allow you to have Priests:
Buddhist Stupa     : 2 Citizens  =   1 Priest
Buddhist Temple    : 1 Citizen   =   1 Priest
Christian Cathedral: 2 Citizens  =   1 Priest
Christian Temple   : 1 Citizen   =   1 Priest
Confucian Academy  : 2 Citizens  =   1 Priest
Confucian Temple   : 1 Citizen   =   1 Priest
Hindu Mandir       : 2 Citizens  =   1 Priest
Hindu Temple       : 1 Citizen   =   1 Priest
Islamic Mosque     : 2 Citizens  =   1 Priest
Islamic Temple     : 1 Citizen   =   1 Priest
Jewish Synagogue   : 2 Citizens  =   1 Priest
Jewish Temple      : 1 Citizen   =   1 Priest
Taoist Pagoda      : 2 Citizens  =   1 Priest
Taoist Temple      : 1 Citizen   =   1 Priest
Angkor Wat (WW)    : 3 Citizens  =   1 Priest
The Chruch of the
Nativity (SW)      : 3 Citizens  =   1 Priest
The Dai Miao (SW)  : 3 Citizens  =   1 Priest
The Kashi 
Vishwanath (SW)    : 3 Citizens  =   1 Priest
The Kong Miao (SW) : 3 Citizens  =   1 Priest
The Mahabodhi (SW) : 3 Citizens  =   1 Priest
The Masjid 
al-Haram (SW)      : 3 Citizens  =   1 Priest
The Temple of 
Solomon (SW)       : 3 Citizens  =   1 Priest

Scientist
As the name suggests, the Scientist will specialise in the art of producing
research points for your empire. Every turn, he will produce 3 research points
for you as well as 3 Great Person Points. Having him will make it more likely
for your city to generate a Great Scientist when the next Great Person is 
spawned.

Buildings that will allow you to have Scientists:
Laboratory         : 1 Citizen   =   1 Scientist
Library            : 2 Citizens  =   1 Scientist
Observatory        : 1 Citizen   =   1 Scientist
The Great Library  : 2 Free Scientists upon Completion

There are also some wonders that will enhance the abilities of the specialists
in this game.

Angkor Wat
Effect: +1 Hammer from Priest in All Cities


The Sistine Chapel
Effect: +2 Culture per Specialist in All Cities


The Statue of Liberty
Effect: +1 Free Specialist in All Cities on the Continent

There are two civics that can improve the use of the Specialists.

The Caste System
You can have unlimited artists, merchants and scientists in a city.

Representation
All specialists have a +3 Research production bonus.

[3.09] Technology

Man, by himself is not the strongest species. We don't have the keenest senses
nor do we possess the most strength. Man has ever only been as good as the
technology that he uses. That is mankind's speciality over the other species,
our ability to manipulate the surrounding environment to empower us. For
example, two technologies, primative and still used today, manipulates the
environment to their environment. These are the discovery of fire and the
development of the Wheel. 

There are many ways to discover technology. Lets go through the lesser used 
methods. 

Starting technologies are given to your Civilisation. What starting 
technologies are given to you are based off your Civilisation. These are 
primative technologies and can easily by Civilisations that lack it.

Tribal villages can also give you technologies, as well as give them maps,
money or attack them. The amount of these villages are limited so you have to
be quick before someone else pays a visit.

Diplomacy can be a good option if Technology Trading is enabled. You can trade
or buy technologies off other Civilsations that you don't possess. It also 
works the other way, you can make money by selling technologies you possess 
which others don't.

However, the most common method is researching. You will find it easier to 
survive if you are more technologically advanced. Your army may outnumber 
another army by 10 to 1, but if you have a bunch of warriors and archers and
your opponent has Mechanised Infantry and Modern Armour, you don't stand a 
chance. 

A technology will require you to develop research points before you can 
acquire the technology. The more research points you generate, the faster your
Civilisation can acquire new technologies. The amount of research points that
you can generate is a percentage of your commerce output. You can adjust this
rate by changing the investment percentages. There are also other ways to 
increase the resource point output. You can have Specialists, such as the
Scientist to give a boost, as well as building libraries, observatories and so
forth to provide a boost. You can change your Civics to increase the output
of research points. You can increase your commerce output and you can increase
your wealth output, which can allow you to invest more in science. 

When you start, you will be prompted to choose a technology to research. This
will occur every time you finish researching a technology. Some technologies
will have prerequisites before you can research. That means that you need to
have knowledge of a certain technology before you can research another. At
other times, you can change the technology required and substitute it with 
another one. As one of the developers put it, could one develop Rocketry by
discovering Flight or be inspired by Artillery? These are called alternate
paths or gates. 

You can press F6 to view the Tech Tree. This will show you the technologies 
that you can research, the one is researching and the ones you have and can
research. Click on a tech and the game will develop the quickest path to 
reach that tech. You can view the amount of turns needed to develop the 
technology at the top of the screen with the technology and a number in 
brackets, representing the turns still needed. The green bar is the progress
made.

You can also change the technology researching by clicking on the progress
bar on the top of the screen. This will allow you to pick another one to
research. Just click on the icon of the technology you want to research. Your
progress with the cancelled technology will not be removed and will be still
there when you resume. However, starting the second technology will be to be
started from the beginning.

[4.01] Nations

Note: Do not take my opinion as the holy word, it is my opinion on the race. 
      Everyone has their own preference and its up to you which nation you
      want to use. I prefer the Chinese but other use the English, the Spanish
      and others. Choose a nation, and practice till perfect. 

The American Empire

Leaders
Franklin Roosevelt
George Washington

Special Unit
Navy Seals (Gunpowder Unit)
Replaces the Marine
Strength = 24
Movement = 1
* 1-2 First Strikes
* +50% attack against machine guns
* +50% attack against artillery
* Starts with Amphibious and March
Requires Industrialism and Rifling

Starting Technologies
Fishing
Agriculture

My Opinion
The Americans are excellent if you are playing on maps where food resources 
are important early game. This would help you build a larger population in the
beginning, which can help significantly throughout the game. Their navy seal
units are quite powerful with their abilities because, with a large navy, you
can get your forces to establish a powerful force. They also heal while moving
which can help.


The Arabian Empire

Leader
Saladin

Special Unit
Camel Archer (Mounted Unit)
Replaces the Knight
Strength = 10
Movement = 2
* Immune to First Strikes
* Doesn't Receive Defensive Bonuses
* Can Withdraw from Combat (25% Chance)
Requires Guild
Requires Horseback Riding and Archery

Starting Technologies
Mysticism
The Wheel

My Opinion
Their access to the wheel at the start can help acquire resources quickly with
the ability to build roads and their mysticism can help establish several 
religions quickly, allowing a city where that religion is formed in your 
nation. Their camel archers are handy due to the immunity but don't pick this
race to spam archers. 


The Aztec Empire

Leader
Montezuma

Special Unit
Jaguar (Melee Unit)
Replaces the Swordsman
Strength = 5
Movement = 1
* +10% City Attack
* +25% Jungle Defence
Requires Iron Working

Starting Technologies
Mysticism
Hunting

My Opinion
The Aztecs are handy as well with their access to Mysticism and hunting is 
nice to have a boost from fur and deer, but a reminder that fur will become
obselete after a long while. Their Jaguar unit are powerful in tropical maps
due to the jungle defence and their bonus. Reminder that swordsman are quite
slow and the Jaguar is no exception. 


The Chinese Empire

Leaders
Mao Zedong
Qin Shi Huang

Special Unit
Cho-Ko-Nu (Archery Unit)
Replaces Crossbowman
Strength = 6
Movement = 1
* 2 First Strikes
* Cause Collateral Damage
* +50% attack against Melee Units
Requires Machinery
Requires Archery
Requires Iron

Starting Technologies
Argiculture
Mining

My Opinion
I like the Chinese because their starting technologies are quite handy. After
developing the wheel, their access to resources will prove a significant 
factor. Their special unit, the Cho-Ko-Nu, is extremely useful due to their 
double first strike, their collateral damage and their bonus against melee
units, which at that current point in time, will make the backbone of any 
army. 


The Egyptian Empire

Leader
Hatshepsut

Special Unit
War Chariot (Mounted Unit)
Replaces Chariot
Strength = 5
Movement = 2
* Immune to First Strikes
* Doesn't Receive Defensive Bonuses
* Can Withdraw From Combat (20% Chance)
Requires The Wheel
Requires Horse

Starting Technologies
The Wheel
Agriculture

My Opinion
Their access will be unrivaled in terms of accessing argicultural resources
such as rice, corn and wheat. This will secure a stable, large flow of food 
as well as the health bonus that comes with the granary. Their chariots are
good scouting units that are hard to take down with their immunity and their
chance to withdraw from combat.


The English Empire

Leaders
Elizabeth
Victoria

Special Unit
Redcoat (Gunpowder Unit)
Replaces Rifleman
Strength = 16
Movement = 1
* +25% attack against Mounted Units
* +25% attack against Gunpowder Units
Requires Rifling

Starting Technologies
Fishing
Mining

My Opinion
The British are better in terms of special unit than anything else. Their 
starting technologies can help in having a boost in sailing and accessing 
the seas, but you can't access the harbour till later, making a health boost
not a factor in choosing. Their redcoat units are useful in their age, and 
even later on since mounted and gunpowder units are the armies of the 
opposition. 


The French Empire

Leaders
Louis XIV
Napoleon

Special Unit
Musketeer (Gunpowder Unit)
Replaces Musketman
Strength = 9
Movement = 2
Requires Gunpowder

Starting Technologies
The Wheel 
Argiculture

My Opinion
Their starting technologies are the same to the Egyptians so read above. The
musketeers are useful for one reason. Their movement is TWO. This makes it 
have the same movement as a mounted unit. This can lead to two attacks or
two pillages instead of one. And makes a good unit to escape if you don't want
to lose a valuable promoted unit. 


The German Empire

Leaders
Bismarck
Frederick

Special Unit
Panzer (Armoured Unit)
Replaces Tank
Strength = 28
Movement = 2
* Doesn't Receive Defensive Bonuses
* +50% attack against Armoured Units
* Starts with Blitz
Requires Industrialism
Requires Rifling
Requires Oil

Starting Techonologies
Hunting
Argiculture

My Opinion
The Germans opening technologies are useful in conditions where there is a 
large amount of tundra or you are next the top or bottom of the map. Their
panzers are basically anti-tank units. Their blitz ability can let them a
attack several times and their strength is quite high. These are not to be 
taken lightly. 


The Greek Empire

Leader
Alexander

Special Unit
Phalanx (Melee Unit)
Replaces Spearman
Strength = 5
Movement = 1
* +25% Hill Defence
* +100% attack against Mounted Units
Requires Hunting
Requires Copper or Iron

Starting Technologies
Fishing
Hunting

My Opinion
It seems the Greek empire starting techs are dealing with killing animals. 
This is even more useful in tundra conditions where there would be fish in the
sea and deers to hunt. Their phalanx are useful for killing enemies with 
horses, while they hide up in the hills. Something you shouldn't send your
horse riders against. 


The Incan Empire

Leader
Huayna Capac

Special Unit
Quechua (Melee Unit)
Replaces Warrior
Strength = 2
Movement = 1
* +25% City Defence
* +100 attack against Archery Units

Starting Technologies
Mysticism
Agriculture

My Opinion
Their opening techs seem not well matched but along with other nations with
the mysticism start, they can found a new religion. Useful only of you want
to have that religion's wonder in your city. Their special units make good 
archer killers, which would take a while to develop. 


The Indian Empire

Leaders
Asoka
Gandhi

Special Unit
Fast Worker
Replaces Worker
Movement = 3
* Can Improve Tiles

Starting Technologies
Mysticism
Mining

My Opinion
Their technologies are the same for the Incans, they seem a bit mismatched. 
Their real skill is in their fast workers. They are indeed that they seem, 
they are fast with 3 movement spaces. On a railroad, that means they can 
travel 30 spaces. Thats is for most people, from one side of their empire
to another. This would teach the others to knock out your improvements. 


The Japanese Empire

Leaders
Tokugawa

Special Unit
Samurai (Melee Unit)
Replaces Maceman
Strength = 8
Movement = 1
* 2 First Strikes
* +50% attack against melee units
Requires Civil Service
Requires Machinery
Requires Iron

Starting Technologies
Fishing
The Wheel

My Opinion
I don't know why you would want the wheel with fishing. But still, the wheel
allows early access to resources, so it is handy none the less. Fishing is 
only useful if you need it, or have access to the sea. Their special units
are handy as they can defeat units of equal strength or even above. 


The Malinese Empire

Leader
Mansa Musa

Special Unit
Skirmisher (Archery Unit)
Replaces Archer
Strength = 4
Movement = 1
* 1-2 First Strikes
* +50% City Defence
* +25% Hills Defence
Requires Archery

Starting Technologies
The Wheel
Mining

My Opinion
These starting abilities allow you to access the mines and dig for gold, or 
silver, or whatever you find. Great if you need some gold or money early on
to complete works. Their archer units are quite useful to defend yourself
early on in the game, especially if you have raging barbarians in the game
which can ruin you before you can even get established. 


The Mongolian Empire

Leaders
Genghis Khan
Kublai Khan

Special Unit
Keshik (Mounted Unit)
Replaces Horse Archer
Strength = 6
Movement = 2
* 1 First Strike
* Doesn't Receive Defensive Bonuses
* Ignore Terrain Movement Costs
* +50% attack against Catapult
Requires Horseback Riding
Requires Archery
Requires Horse

Startingd Technologies
The Wheel
Hunting

My Opinion
Great if you like to go hunting, but there are only three resources. Fur, deer
and ivory. But then again, ivory is extremely rare in games, and acquiring it
first should give you an economical advantage. Their special units are useful
as they ignore terrain costs, important if you have jungles or hills and the
such to move through. 


The Persian Empire

Leader
Cyrus

Special Unit
Immortal (Mounted Unit)
Replaces Chariot
Strength = 4
Movement = 2
* Can Withdraw from Combat (30% Chance)
* +50% attack against Archery Units
Requires The Wheel
Requires Horse

Starting Technologies
Argiculture
Hunting

My Opinion
Their starting techs are a bit mismatched but can help you acquire the rare
hunting resources and a stable supply of food. Their immortals are useful in
that they can withdraw from combat and kill archers. But there is one 
weakness in these chariots. They only have 4 strength, which can be kicked 
with 2 warriors if luck goes in the proper direction. 


The Roman Empire

Leader
Julius Caesar

Special Unit
Praetorian (Melee Unit)
Replaces Swordsman
Strength = 8
Movement = 1
Requires Iron Working
Requires Iron

Starting Technologies
Fishing
Mining

My Opinion
This guy really has it going for him. His starting techs can allow him to 
take the fish and the gold. However, the starting techs are not as useful as
the praetorian. The strength of that unit is higher than the swordsman and
equal to the maceman. So, this could give you the edge against a higher tech
opponent.


The Russian Empire

Leader
Catherine
Peter

Special Unit
Cossack (Mounted Unit)
Replaces Calvary
Strength = 18
Movement = 2
* Doesn't Receive Defensive Bonuses
* Can Withdraw from Combat (30% Chance)
* +50% attack against cannons
* +50% attack against mounted units
Requires Military Tradition
Requires Gunpowder and Horseback Riding
Requires Horse

Starting Technologies
Hunting
Mining

My Opinion
The Russians are having problems with their skills as hunting is basically 
useless, bar the fact of the deer resource and accessing archery. The mining
is useful but not fully used unless there are roads. The cossacks are powerful</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
as they have 3 more strength than their calvary counterparts. And they have 
an extra bonus against mounted units, which sooner, would be useless. 


The Spanish Empire

Leader
Isabella

Special Unit
Conquistador (Mounted Units)
Replaces Knight
Strength = 10
Movement = 2
* Immune to First Strikes
* +50% attack against Melee Units
Requires Guilds
Requires Horseback Riding
Requires Horse
Requires Iron

Starting Technologies
Mysticism
Fishing

My Opinion
Their access to religion early on can give them a religious advantage in 
keeping your population happy, but their special unit is a lot weaker. They
only have an extra bonus against melee units which at this stage, shouldn't
be much of a problem.

So far, you can see that the grassland is the best place to build farms to 
produce food as it has 2 food production. The coast is excellent to place and
develop cottages into large towns. Plains are your average terrain. Oceans is
exactly what you find in the sea. The desert and the ice do nothing so don't
farm there hoping to find food. Peaks cannot be passed or built upon. Tundra
is unavoidable if you are up north or south. 

Terrain Features
Terrain features is exactly what you will find on the terrain. Sometimes there
would be hills or a wild jungle. Not all the land will be flat or rolling with
lush green grass.

[4.04] Bonuses

These are the resources that you will find on the terrain that you can 
improve and develop. These will provide more production, food or commerce than
a normal tile without this resource. Also, there are perks owning these 
resources because some buildings and units require these resources, such as 
horses for horse archers. Another perk is that some buildings have their 
construction time halved with access to this resource. Note that you have to 
have connection via road or rail to the resource in order to access it. You
don't see corn flying to the main city here, nor in real life. Or does it?
The improved bonus is combining the upgrade and the base bonus together. Note,
some of the improved bonus may add up wrong since there may be problems. All 
this information is direct from the game itself. 

NOTE: The effects such as meeting unit requirements, additional effects and 
      halving construction time requires only one of each resource. There is
      no stack bonus, unfortunately, but bonuses still apply. 
NOTE: All effects are from the 1.61v of Civilisation IV, not the original.

[4.06] Religion

Through the ages, people have believe in a higher being on a different plane.
There have been many religions throughout the history of Earth and 7 of them
have been covered in Civilisation IV. But there are some things that have to
be cleared up first.

A state religion is the religion that your State believes in. When you 
discover the necessary technology to access a religion, you have the ability
to make that your state religion. When a city believes in a religion that 
happens to be the state religion, the city will enjoy a boost in productivity,
happiness and gold. 

You can also spread a religion. Religious buildings will spread the religion
to other cities, but you can also have a part to say in where the religion
is to be spread. This can be done through the will of the missionary (nearly
wrote mercenary). The religion will spread to cities that it has trade routes
with, with religious buildings quickening the boost. 

Missionaries can be built in two ways. You can have the organised religion
civic which allows you to have the ability to build missionaries or you can
build monasteries to build missionaries. Once a missionary is trained, the
unit will cost two gold to maintain every turn. The missionary can be moved
like any other unit, cross through unclaimed and neutral territory but can 
only move within another civilisation when you have signed an open borders
agreement with them. 

When the missionary reaches a target city, you can try to spread the religion
using the "Spread Religion" ability. The success of the missionary is 
dependant on several factors. 

1) It is far easier for a missionary to spread a religion in a city with few
   or no religion in it. This is because one religion does not have to compete
   with another religion.
2) It is easier to spread a religion in your own civilisation if you own the
   missionary. The owner's civilisation will find it easier to convert their
   own people.
3) Even if there are a fair number of religions in a city, a city can house 
   all 7 religions, except it will be more hard to spread on each new 
   religion. 

There are also benefits of having a religion. 

1) By having a religion in a city, you have the ability to develop 3 
   religious buildings in your cities. This will provide a boost in the 
   happiness, the wealth and the culture from your cities.
2) It provides 5 culture per turn if you have the holy city of a religion 
   that happens to be the state religion. 
3) It provides +1 Happiness and +1 Culture per turn if the state religion
   is present in a city.
4) A city without a religion cannot have the priest specialist.
5) If you have a Holy City with the developed Shrine upon it, if any players
   have that specific religion as a state religion, you can spy upon their
   cities. 

There are also religion specific buildings. There are 4 of them, the Temple,
the Monastery, the Cathedral and the Shrine.

The Temple
Require the religion of the temple you want to build and the technology of
Priesthood. It is primative and produces 1 Culture and 1 Happiness. It allows
for 1 Citizen to become a Priest.


The Monastery
It is more advanced than the temple, requiring Meditation and the religion
of the monastery. It provides 10% more research points a turn as well as 2
culture per turn. It's the only way to produce a missionary bar the Organised
Religion civic. It will be obsolete with Scientific Method. 

The Cathedral
The most advanced of the religious buildings. It requires Music, the religion
and 3 of those Religion's temple. Its construction speed can be halved with
certain resources. If will give +2 Happiness if the religion is that state
religion, turn 2 Citizen points to a Priest and gain +1 Happiness from the
Incense resource. It +50% your culture production as well. You have to have
3 temples to produce 1 Cathedral. For example, if you have 21 Temples, you
can only have 7 Cathedrals as most. 

The Shrine
It can only be established in the Holy City of a certain religion. It gives
4 culture per turn, +1 Gold for every city with that religion and can turn
3 Citizen points into a priest. The addition of every city with that religion
shows the importance of the missionary to spread the word to as many cities
as you can.


The Beliefs
There are 7 Beliefs in the Game. Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity, 
Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. There are a few things you need to note
down. If you have the Holy City of the State Religion, you get a +4 bonus to
your culture. If you have a City with the Religion the same as the State
Religion, you will get a small +1 culture bonus. All religions will give a
missionary upon development except Buddhism, Judaism and Hinduism

                  interstellar travel and colonisation whil providing for the
                  long term needs of its occupants. 
Effects         : Required for Space Victory, 1 needed
                  Space Victory must be enabled

                  and heat to the colonists inside the SS. Recycling is the
                  key, no organic waste is to leave the SS. Waste is processed
                  with algae which consumes the waste or processes it into 
                  fertilizer for the Hydroponics Garden. The garden provides
                  food, oxygen, and other necessities.

SS Stasis Chamber
Type of Project : Team
Requires        : Apollo Project, Genetics
Hammers Needed  : 1200 Hammers
Description     : The problem with the trip on the SS was that it would take
                  decades, if not centuries, so that would be a problem for
                  the engineers. How to stop the aging process? Advances in
                  cyrogenics have allowed to deep freeze bodies without much
                  harm and to heat the bodies up automatically by computer
                  when the time came to colonisation.

                  SS. When the boosters for the thrusters are empty, they are
                  jettisoned. When this occurs, powerful electromagnets 
                  help accelerate the charged particles of the ion drive to 
                  activating it, allowing it to travel near the speed of 
                  light. 
Effects         : Required for Space Victory, 3 needed
                  Space Victory must be enabled

[4.08] Improvements

While on the map, you can see squares with resources or terrain that you think
to yourself, how do I make the most of it? You have to improve it of course. 
Improvements are built by workers, who can keep building them. This is unlike
settlers, who are just one off builders. 

You can only build improvements within your cultural borders, but a good idea
is to build them within your city radius so you can actually access the 
resources and the production benefits. To build improvements, you have to move
your workers over a certain tile that you can build an improvement on and 
select the improvement that you want. Note that you can only build it if you
have the necessary technology. Work boats are the same as workers, they are
the workers of the water, where your workers can't go.

You can also build roads and railroads by manually selecting them to where
to build or you can use the route to button to make them buuild roads to a 
selected point. 

Improvements take time to complete so be patient. It isn't an overnight job
you know. You can interrupt construction by selecting the worker and giving
him a new job to do.

Military units can pillage your improvements for gold. If there are multiple
improvements such as a farm and a railroad, you can only pillage one at a 
time. Note that the roaming barbarians will happily pillage your improvements.

NOTE: Cottage can only be buits, then grows to Hamlet, then to Village and 
      ends at Town

[5.01] Great People

Once every now and then, a Great Person will be born, changing the way we 
think. People such as Homer, Newton, Curie, Einstein, etc will come long and
change the way history things. In Civilisation IV, there are five different 
types of Great People. Great Artists, Great Scientists, Great Merchants, 
Great Priest and Great Engineers. 

Great People are generated from Great People points. Each city has its 
seperate pool of Great People points. There are many generators of these 
points, including Specialists, Civics, Buildings and Wonders. The amount
needed to generate a Great Person originally starts at 100, and once a Great
Person is generated, it will increase by 100. Of course, with different game
speeds, it costs more or less to generate such a Person. The amount of points
need is the same for all the cities in your empire. 

There are several influences on the type of person to be produced. Whenever
you have a specialist, it will be more likely to generate a Great Person 
based on their specialisation. Wonders will also change the odds of the 
Person. When you hover over the Great Person Bar on the city screen, you can
view the odds of Generating such a person. Increasing the amount of a certain
amount of specialists, you can change the person generated. 

There are several abilities that a Great Person can do. These abilities are 
the same for all Great People.

Discover a Technology
You can sacrifice a Great Person to help you research a technology. The 
technology that they can help research will generally be in their field of
expertise, such as a Prophet researching a Religious technology or a Merchant
researching an Economic technology. In the earlier ages, while the technology
costs are relatively low, the Great Person should discover it straight away
but in the newer, futuristic technologies, they can only contribute a portion
of the technology.


Starting a Golden Age
You can use two or more Great People, sacrifice them to produce a Golden Age
for you, which will be elaborated on later. 


Settling in Cities
You can sacrifice your Great People to have them settle in your cities to 
become a super specialist. They have the same traits as a normal specialist
but their rate of production is higher and better. 

Great Artist
This guy is a super artist, with a whopping 3 Gold per turn and producing 
12 culture points for the city every turn.

Great Engineer
This guy is a bigger engineer, who produces 3 Hammers per turn for the city
and 3 Research points towards your research.

Great Merchant
This person is indeed a Great Merchant providing a special commodity to your
city. He provides 6 Gold per turn and 1 food unit per turn. So in essence, he
only consumes 1 food a turn.

Great Prophet
This person is an advanced priest. He can produce 2 Hammers per turn as well
as 5 Gold per turn for your city every turn.

Great Scientist
This smart person is a powerful brother to the normal scientist. He can 
produce 1 Hammer per turn as well as 6 Research points per turn towards your
scientific research.

There are also specific abilities for each Great Person. The ability is user
specific, and they don't share abilities. 


Great Artist - Create Major Works of Art
By creating a Major Work of Art, the sacrifice of the Great Artist will 
provide a boost of 2000 to 6000 points in a city as a one off bonus. The 
amount depends on the game speed you are using. This is extremely useful to
save your city if it desperately needs to expand or needs to war off a 
cultural war.


Great Engineer - Hurry Production
Great Engineers can hurry the production of Wonders. In the earlier ages, the
Great Engineer will be able to complete the wonder in one fell swoop, but in
the later ages, he can only significantly hurry the speed of construction and
not finish the major work.


Great Merchant - Trade Mission
The Merchant will be able to initiate a trade mission in a foreign city. The
trade mission involves you moving the Merchant into a foreign city and using
his ability in the city. This will give you Gold in return. The more 
wealthier a city is, the more powerful it is and the further away it is, will
provide you with more gold. Take those facts before you use his special 
ability. Amounts can be in the hundreds with the most I have gotten is about
5.6k or 5600 Gold.


Great Prophet - Special Wonder
This is what the point of establishing a religion first is. By establishing 
a religion first, one of your Cities will be the founder of the religion.
When you have a Great Prophet, you can move it over to the founding city and
create a Special Shrine to it. For example, if you are the first to find
Christianity, one of your cities will be the founding city. You can move your
Great Prophet and create the Church of Nativity in that City.


Great Scientist - Academy
The Great Scientist can create the academy, which is a building in your city
that can enhance your research point output per turn. This is a great building
when technology is lagging behind in your empire. 

There are several ways that you can increase the production of these points.

National Wonders

National Epic
Effect: Increases Great Person Points Production by 100%


World Wonders
The Parthenon
Effect: Increases Great Person Points Production by 50%

Scientist : +3 Great Person Points


Civics

Pacifism
Effect: +100% Great Person Growth Rate for Cities with State Religion

Some technologies will also give you free Great People. The first to research
the technologies will receive the Great Person. There is only one for each
technology.

Economics    = 1 Great Merchant
Fusion       = 1 Great Engineer
Music        = 1 Great Artist
Physics      = 1 Great Scientist

[5.02] National Wonders

National wonders are wonders, but it isn't for the entire world. You can have
one national wonder per empire. For example, you build a national wonder in
your empire, another civilisation can build the same wonder in their empire.

in a city. 

All National Wonders will produce +1 Great Person point per turn in the city
that is it built in.

[5.04] World Wonders

There are buildings that have withstood the test of time, and survive today.
They changed the path of time since its establishment. They require much work
and time from your cities, but they are well worth it.

There are two types of wonders, National and Great. National wonders have
already been exaplained above. Great wonders are so unique that only one can
be built, no more. If a Great Wonder is destroyed through the capture of a 
city, that Wonder is lost forever, and cannot be rebuilt. Whoever constructs
a wonder first will reap the rewards. 

Losing the race to construct a wonder will lead to your lost hammers turning
into gold. Your construction of the wonder will be discontinued immediately. 
National Wonders aren't a problem since each civilisation can have one. 
Wonders can be built like any other buildings and some resources can halve the
construction time necessary. Those leaders with the Industrious trait can 
build Wonders at double the speed one would normally produce. However, over 
time, as you develop more technology, they will become obsolete.

[5.06] Civics

Civics the various forms of Government and their position to their people. 
They can be despots or presidents, have absolute or no control over the
economy and choose what religions you have to believe in. 

Each civic has a different effect. Some are more useful in some situations 
while the other civics are more useful in other situations. You will start 
with the most basic civics and have to research more powerful forms of 
civics. 

There are 5 different sorts of Civics: Government, Labor, Legal, Economy and
Religion. 

Each civic has an upkeep of no, low, medium or high. This is the cost on your
economy to employ each civic. Generally speaking, the higher upkeep it costs,
the more useful and powerful the civic is. But being powerful doesn't mean
much if you can't afford to keep it that way. In fact, some civics are better
because they require no cost. The cost will depend on the amount of cities 
and the population. The larger of either of them, or both, the more upkeep you
will have to pay. 

When you want to change civics, you have to go to your domestic advisor and
change the civic you want by clicking on it. Then you have to go through a
revolution. You may experience anarchy but if you have the spiritual trait 
in a leader, you won't. When you move through an anarchy period, citizens will
not produce anything, no food, no research, no production, no commerce. After
your turns of anarchy, your citizens will be back to normal and produce the
resources as normal. There will be a delay period before you can have another
revolution. Change can only be adapted to after a period.

[5.08] Promotions

In battle, you will find that your battle harden troops will survive better
than your new green recruits. They are better than your new troops and better
seeing that the other guys gets beaten up badly. 

Your units will be able to get promotions by acquiring the necessary XP points
to level up. There are several sources of XP points.

The barracks will grant your troops +4 Experience Points for every new land
unit created. Drydocks are the naval equalivant. The West Point Academy will
grant you +4 Experience points for every unit in that city created. The 
Pentagon will grant +2 Experience Points in all cities. The civics can also
give a boost. Vassalage will grant all new units with 2 Experience Points 
while Theocracy will grant +2 Experience Points to all units created in 
cities with the State Religion

The most common way for units to gain Experience Points is through combat.
For destroying an enemy units, regardless of what it is, you will have the
victorious unit gain an XP. 

Some units will start with promotions depending on what it is. Most will be
special units. An example is the Navy SEAL of the American Empire who will
be given March. Some Wonders will give a promotion, such as the Red Cross
who will give the Medic I promotion for all units created in that city.

[5.09] Other Stuffs

This section will contain the other stuff I couldn't fit elsewhere.

Animals
There are roaming animals that will attack whoever they want. They will attack
your units, making settlers and workers at risk. You will have to protect
them with your military. As more of the world is claim, they will disappear. 


Barbarians
These are roaming humans looking for something to steal. In constrast to the
animals, they will come into your land and attack you. They are far more 
dangerous and can even start cities, developing the land around them.


Golden Age
This is when your civilisation is slowing with extra knowledge. During this
period, your farms produce more, your mines produce more, everything will be
increased in produciton. It lasts for 8 turns. It is started by the Taj
Mahal wonder and by sacrificing 2 Great People.

[6.02] v1.52

v1.52 is a major upgrade to Civ IV and includes numerous optimizations for 
memory usage that should help performance on all machines but are tailored to 
especially improve performance on machines at or near the minimum 
specification.
 
Major memory reductions include:
 
-Shared low-level graphics buffers 
-Removed many unused fonts and reduced interface memory usage
-Paged out units which are not visible
-Reduced terrain data size and overhead
-Reduced route data size
-Created a set of low-res movies for machines without dynamic texture support 
 (this will be available as a separate download)
 
These changes not only reduced the amount of system memory required, but 
lowered video memory usage extensively. Also, the rate at which the game 
consumes memory in the late-game has decreased, which is extremely important.
   
Suggestions for optimal performance:
 
Increase AGP memory size in your BIOS settings to 128 or 256 if necessary. 
Go to www.windowsupdate.com and apply updates 
Update graphics and sound drivers 
Close other background applications 
Turn graphics to low and use low-resolution textures in the options screen 
Turn off Antialiasing in your display properties

[7.01] Basic Guide 

When playing a custom game, you will receive two units, a warrior unit and 
some settlers. Settle next to some resources, food resources being the most
useful. By settling next to food resources, you don't have to worry about food
for the moment. Set your warriors to explore the world around you, especially
those squares about 5 tiles away from your established city. This is because
you sooner or later have to start a new city, and some rare resources. You
should first build a worker for one reason. To make your tiles more productive
and produce more. You first objective is to improve tiles next to water, a
plop a farm there if not obstructed by a rare resource. Constantly improve the
land. Your next unit to train is settlers.

Once you have decided where to build the next city, construct it. Theres a 
tip about cities. Inland cities generally have good access to one of the two
things. Food or production. Building a city next to a river will provide far
more food than one in the middle of the desert. Building a city next to a 
wealth of hills will certainly provide a large amount of hammer. These will
be your most productive cities in terms of hammers. Then there are coastal
cities. Generally speaking, half of the squares a city could use are located
in the sea. Although they don't provide a lot of resources, a fish, crab or
clam resource will provide enough food for at least 2 people. There are also
upgrades to make it more productive. 

Another type of city is a grassland city, a city surrounded generally by
grassland. These are the best places to put cottages and farms as they will
produce far more. Plain cities are your average cities as they provide a 
little food, a little production. Desert cities are those, well, stuck in the
middle of the desert. There will be come rare resources like incense and ivory
but no food unless there is an oasis nearby. Tundra cities will have fur, deer
and some mining goods but unless there is a river or a source of fresh water,
they won't survive unless saved by some resources in the sea. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7.02] Peace

Thats the only thing you will need to survive to mid game, peace. You will
need to be friendly with all your neighbours to survive. You should 
concentrate on your economy and your citys production. Use the ability of 
technology really quick and level up your units. After all, several strong
knights will easily defeat an army of warriors. Gold is your friend, use it
to get maps and friends. After all, the more people to defend you, the less
likely a rogue nation will attack you. And please, fortify your cities and
your rare resources with units so in case you get attacked, you can defend
yourself. Defensive Pacts are very useful.
