===============================================================================
I. The Object of the Game
===============================================================================

The object of the game is to drive the car down a winding road, fending off 
other cars, turrets, motorcycles, even various obstacles in the road to reach 
the finish line before fuel runs out.

On each level the car is given a certain amount of fuel that slowly decreases 
as time passes. Approximately halfway through each level the car receives a 
fuel bonus. If the car runs out of fuel at any time, it begins to slow down. If 
it comes to a complete stop before reaching a level midpoint or the finish 
line, the game is over.

The bottom of the screen details the car's current status, including:

Current score multiplier
Mine detector
Main and reserve fuel tank gauges
Current speed
Current score
Special weapon indicator

If at any time the car comes in contact with an enemy or gets shot by a turret, 
the car explodes and a new one is set up in the middle of the road.

At the end of each level, bonus points and additions to the reserve tank are 
awarded based on the current multiplier, up to a maximum of 10,000 points. The 
multiplier increases by one every time an enemy is shot with the regular gun 
(up to a maximum of 10x), and decreases by one with every regular shot that 
misses a target. The multiplier does not change as a result of firing the 
special weapon UZ Cannon (neither hits nor misses from the UZ Cannon change 
the multiplier). All points earned are multiplied by the resulting multiplier 
(e.g., if an orange car is shot with a 1x multiplier, the multiplier goes up to 
2x and 2x50=100 points are earned).

===============================================================================
III. Special Weapons and Other Items
===============================================================================

At predetermined points of most levels, a plane flies overhead and drops an 
apparatus. Drive the car underneath it to catch it and equip it to the car. If 
the car crashes, the special weapon is lost. If the car reaches the finish line 
with an unused portion of a special weapon, the unused portion carries over to 
the next level. If a new weapon is caught while an unused weapon is attached, 
the unused weapon is lost and replaced by the new one. There are four different 
weapons: 

1. UZ Cannon      - Rapid fire gun, doesn't affect multiplier, lasts a while
2. Nitro Inject   - Very high speed for a short time, 3 uses
3. Cruise Missile - Destroy everything on screen (good and bad), 3 uses
4. Electro Shield - Makes the car invincible for about 5 seconds, 3 uses

Occasionally, green globes appear on the road. Pick these up by driving over 
them to increase the car's fuel by a small amount. Destroyed orange cars may 
leave orange globes behind. These restore more fuel than the green ones, and 
are essential on levels when there is a shortage on fuel to begin with (See the 
"Sensors detect fuel globes" explanation in the List of Levels section).

===============================================================================
IV. The Enemy
===============================================================================

Here is a list of the enemies to be faced (point value in parentheses):

Orange Cars (50) - They are the most common enemy seen, and they are the 
easiest to deal with. Shoot them once to destroy them.

Blue Cars (100) - These cars cannot be destroyed normally. Certain special 
weapons can get rid of them. However, like the orange car, it doesn't launch 
any attacks, it simply gets in the way on the road.

Motorcycles (100) - Similar to orange cars, they are destroyed with one shot 
but are much smaller and harder to hit than the orange cars.

Rat Jeeps (50) - These tricky rascals sneak up and try to ram the car from 
behind. Sometimes a warning is issued at the beginning of the level that they 
are coming, but sometimes not. Stay alert for them, especially in the later 
levels.

Turrets (200) - These are stationary guns on the side of the road that fire a 
steady pattern of bullets. They are easier to shoot on turns since they are 
right in front of the car. On straight-aways their shots are easily avoided by 
simply driving straight down the middle of the road at maximum speed.

Mine (none) - Next to the reserve tank indicator there is a box that sometimes 
flashes along with an audible warning. When it flashes, there are mines are on 
the road nearby. Sometimes they can be very difficult to see on the road. 
Driving over a mine causes a crash. They cannot be destroyed.

Toxic Spill (none) - These black puddles in the road cause the car to do a 360 
degree spin at its current speed, often causing the car to crash directly into 
oncoming traffic. Avoid them whenever possible.

Boulders (none) - Don't drive on the shoulder unless necessary to drive around 
an enemy. The car slows down dramatically, and if a boulder is nearby, the car 
probably crashes into it. Level 35 is odd in that the first enemy encountered 
is a boulder in the middle of the road (!). Keep alert for it.

===============================================================================
V. List of Levels
===============================================================================

Each section can be divided into levels, as follows:

Bubble City     -  1 to  3
Forest Section  -  4 to 10
Desert Region   - 11 to 14
Ground Zero     - 15 to 18
Crystal Palace  - 19 to 22
Weapons Factory - 23 to 26
Power Plant     - 27 to 30
Science Complex - 31 to 34
Molten Zone     - 35 to 38
Ground Zero     - 39 to 42
Bubble City     - 43 to 46
Sunset Strip    - 47 to 50

Here's a list of each level's message displayed before the level begins, any 
weapons available in that level, and any other important notes to consider. The 
first four messages seen are simply general tips for playing the game.

If the message is "Sensors detect fuel globes", the car starts the level with a 
low fuel gauge, however, the orange cars in that level drop orange globes much 
more often. Pick them up to survive.

If the message is "Rat Jeep wave, Watch for cross traffic", Rat Jeeps are 
waiting in that level (see Rat Jeep in section IV). Sometimes this message is 
not given in a level with Rat Jeeps. This generally happens in the first level 
of a new section, since pre-level messages are never given in this case.

Legend for special weapons:
(1) UZ Cannon
(2) Nitro Inject
(3) Cruise Missile
(4) Electro Shield

22 N/A       "Sensors detect fuel globes" This level is different from the 
             other low fuel levels since none of the orange cars drop fuel 
             globes. There are green globes that need to be collected to 
             survive.

34 (4)(4)    "Sensors detect fuel globes"
35 (2)       None (watch for Rat jeeps) As mentioned previously, the first 
             enemy encountered is a boulder sitting smack dab in the middle of 
             the road. Be alert and swerve around it.

42 (4)       None (should be "Sensors detect fuel globes")
43 (1)       None (enemies consist of orange cars only)
44 (4)       None (enemies consist of blue cars only)
45 (2)       None (enemies consist of motorcycles only)
46 (1)       "Rat jeep wave, Watch for cross traffic" (enemies consist of Rat 
             jeeps only)
47 (1)       None (enemies consist of turrets only)
48 (4)       None (enemies consist of mines only)
49 (2)       None (should be "Sensors detect fuel globes") The car begins this 
             level with next to no fuel in the main tank. A full Reserve tank, 
             as well as collecting all orange and green spheres, is necessary 
             to survive.
50 (1)(3)(2) "Final Rally, Tanks Full, One Chance" This final level throws 
             everything at the car (including the kitchen sink), but the car 
             receives two full tanks of fuel to finish it. Just keep shooting 
             and collect as many fuel globes as possible since many crashes 
             await. Good luck!

At the beginning of the game, there is a choice given of where to start: (at 
level 1, 4 or 11). Whichever one is chosen, the game progresses until level 14 
is cleared, at which time another choice is offered (this time level 15, 19, or 
23). Every time four levels are completed, this option is offered, until Ground 
Zero is reached. Since there are only two levels after Ground Zero, Bubble City 
must be driven through to get to Sunset Strip. This allows for a very quick 
completion of the game since tougher levels can be skipped.

===============================================================================
VI. Strategies
===============================================================================

- It is important to master the art of shooting the cars as they approach. At 
first the shooting can be very awkward when driving at full speed due to the 
curves of the road or the enemies switching lanes. Use the first few levels to 
hone the car's shooting skills while the enemies are still easy.

- Keep the multiplier at or near the maximum of 10x at all times. It can be 
very easy to have a bad run where the car crashes multiple times and the 
reserve tank has to be consumed. With a constantly high multiplier, the reserve 
tank is guaranteed to be filled after every level, thus allowing a cushion to 
be retained in case a level is very difficult.

- Don't hold on to the special weapons. Use them up when acquired, since (1) 
they are lost if the car crashes (which happens a lot in later levels), and (2) 
the car can't carry more than one special weapon, and later levels sometimes 
have multiple weapons in one level, so don't be shy about using them quickly.

- Don't make a habit of going after the turrets. If they are encountered on a 
sharp turn and they are directly in front of the car, great, take them out 
while the car turns. But on a straightaway, it is much simpler to just drive 
straight through at maximum speed to avoid their shots rather than risk an 
unnecessary crash.

- Similar to the turrets, don't go after other tough to hit enemies, such as 
motorcycles, especially if they are swerving from side to side, making them 
damn near impossible to hit. It is much more prudent to watch their movements 
and when they swerve to one side, swerve to the other side to pass them.

- At the end of every level is the same straight stretch of road with 3 or 4 
boulders on each side of the road. If the car is low on fuel and this stretch 
of road approaches, simply floor the accelerator and race to the finish line.
